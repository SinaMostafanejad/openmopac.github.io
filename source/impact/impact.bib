	abstract = {The role of stereochemical factors on the structure and the fragmentation paths of the protonated cyclic dipeptide cyclo histidine--phenylalanine is studied under ion traps conditions by combining tandem mass spectrometry, laser spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and chemical dynamics simulations. Vibrational spectroscopy obtained by Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD) reveals a small difference between the two diastereomers, c-{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}LLH{\}}\^{}{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}and c-{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}LDH{\}}\^{}{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}, arising mainly from ancillary CH...{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}uppi {\$}{\$}interactions. In contrast, there is a strong influence of the residues chirality on the collision-induced dissociation (CID) processes. Chemical dynamics simulations rationalize this effect and evidence that proton mobility takes place, allowing isomerization to intermediate cyclic structures that are different for c-{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}LLH{\}}\^{}{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}and c-{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}LDH{\}}\^{}{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}, resulting in different barriers to proton mobility. This effect is related to the protonation of the imidazole ring. It contrasts with the minute stereochemical effects observed for other cyclic dipeptides in which the proton is borne by an amide CO.},

	abstract = {Four dendrimers of the first and second generations containing rigid polyphenylene interior and flexible ferrocenyl-terminated alkyl arms (CH2)m(C5H4)Fe(C5H5) (m = 6, 11) were synthesized by combining two types of ``click'' reactions: Diels-Alder and copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. The resulting compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). CVs of the dendrimers show a single chemically reversible wave. In contrast to wholly aromatic redox-active dendrimers, a combination of rigid polyphenylene interior with flexible alkylferrocenyl periphery provides an electrochemically reversible redox process. The dendrimers exhibit strong adsorption onto the Pt electrode upon oxidation, thus providing fabrication of stable modified electrodes coated with a second-generation dendrimer.},

	abstract = {The choice of simulation methods in computational materials science is driven by a fundamental trade-off: bridging large time- and length-scales with highly accurate simulations at an affordable computational cost. Venturing the investigation of complex phenomena on large scales requires fast yet accurate computational methods. We review the emerging field of machine-learned potentials, which promises to reach the accuracy of quantum mechanical computations at a substantially reduced computational cost. This Review will summarize the basic principles of the underlying machine learning methods, the data acquisition process and active learning procedures. We highlight multiple recent applications of machine-learned potentials in various fields, ranging from organic chemistry and biomolecules to inorganic crystal structure predictions and surface science. We furthermore discuss the developments required to promote a broader use of ML potentials, and the possibility of using them to help solve open questions in materials science and facilitate fully computational materials design.},

@article{JIANG2021101066,
	abstract = {Upregulating the susceptibility of cancer cells to ferroptosis is crucial to upgrade anti-cancer efficiency of ferroptosis drug system. At present, optimizing the sensitizer for ferroptosis with expected mechanism and improved transport via facile nanocarriers still heavily rely on serendipitous discovery and repetitious assignment. Herein, we employ the tannic acid (TA)-templated silicon nanoparticle as nanocore to descend the lysosome-controlled disintegratable Fe3+@erastin@rapamycin micelles (REFSM) to identify rapamycin as a ferroptosis sensitizer through autophagy-dependent/independent pathways. The as-prepared REFSM dissociates responding to the acidic condition and enzyme system of lysosomes, permitting Fe3+ and erastin release to irritate ferroptosis, which is reinforced by released rapamycin via irritating ferritinophagy and lipophagy, and suppressing HIF-1α. The rapamycin-reinforced ferroptosis is demonstrated to be specific to H2O2-overloaded cancer cells. Moreover, the introduction of rapamycin reduces the positive charge of micelle and improves its distribution in tumors. Both the controllable dissociation and the improved charge of REFSM ensure its anti-cancer efficiency at trace amount of erastin (0.3 mg kg−1) and rapamycin (2.2 mg kg−1) and minimize the systematic toxicity. This archetypical template provides a versatile platform for rapamycin as sensitizer to enhance ferroptosis by displaying its multiple pharmacological mechanism, controlling its release and improving its distribution in vivo.},

@article{JOSHI2021121066,
	abstract = {In the ultra-high resolution mass spectrometric analysis of processed petroleums (fossil materials), we observed species with ultra-low hydrogen content (e.g. H/C ratio from 0.1 to 0.4). Some of the observed chemical formula (C20-40H10) can be rationalized by the known corannulene-based peri-condensed Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Other formulas (such as C20-40H8, C20-40H6 and C20-40H4) cannot be rationalized with any known structures. We proposed highly curved non-planar PAHs involving multiple connected five member aromatic rings. These structures do not obey the isolated pentagon rule (IPR). The stabilities of the proposed structures were evaluated by density functional theory. Strain energies were calculated based on hypothetical isodesmic conversion of planar structures to the curved non-planar structures. Results showed that the strain energies of the proposed structures are lower than that of fullerenes of the same carbon number, confirming stabilities of the non-IPR structures. The low hydrogen content species are likely formed in the thermal and/or catalytic cracking of the petroleums. They are possible intermediate molecules on the path toward the formation of fullerenes (buckyballs) and other nano-carbon materials},

	abstract = {The present work aims to develop electroanalytical strategies for separating and quantifying one of the most important biothiols, the reduced glutathione (GSH), based on developing and applying a new and selective magnetic molecular imprinted polymer (mag-MIP). This magnetic-supported polymer was synthesized by precipitation, using GSH as a template, having acrylamide as the functional monomer and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate as a cross-linking agent. These materials' morphological and physical characteristics were investigated by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Physicochemical parameters, such as adsorption capacity, were obtained and compared with the respective mag-NIP, which are control polymers without the selective cavity. After all characterizations, mag-MIP and mag-NIP were evaluated on magnetic graphite-epoxy composite (m-GEC) electrodes. The characteristics of the obtained sensors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. After optimizing experimental and operational conditions, a linear response for the concentration of GSH, in the range of 1 to 1400 μmol/L, with low detection and quantification limits of 7 and 20 nmol/L, respectively, were obtained. The GSH levels in mice liver samples were measured by electrochemical and spectrophotometric techniques to compare the method's effectiveness. A high correlation between them and a low relative error of 1.06% were obtained, indicating the good functionality of the proposed sensor.},

	abstract = {In the present study, five novel LNA based antisense modifications have been proposed. A conformational search was carried out using TANGO, followed by geometry optimization using MOPAC. Based on their electronic energies the most stable conformation for each modification was identified. Further, DFT based full geometry optimization on the most stable conformations at the gas phase B3LYP/631-G(d,p) using Gaussin03 and single point energy calculations on the optimized structures at the solvent phase B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory were done to derive their quantum chemical descriptors using the Gaussian09. A comparison of global reactivity descriptors confirmed that the LNA based modifications were the most reactive. Base-pair stability was recorded by observing the binding energies and base-pairing conformations of modified GC base pairs at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed at the oligomer duplex level by incorporating individual modifications on 20-mer RNA-RNA duplexes using AMBER16. Free energy calculations of duplex structures suggested that incorporation of A2 modification into the RNA-RNA duplex increased the duplex binding affinity similar to LNA. Whereas, the A3 modification showed less binding compared to LNA but improved binding compared to MOE. This computational approach using quantum chemical methods may be very useful to propose better modifications than the existing ones before performing the experiments in the area of antisense technology.},

	n2 = {Abstract A new cocrystal comprising two pharmaceutically important molecules methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (p-MHB) (C8H8O3) and carbonyl diamide (urea) {$[$}CO(NH2)2{$]$} is crystallized together for the first time through restricted solvent evaporation method at ambient conditions. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the engineered cocrystal p-MHB:urea (1:1) (C9H12N2O4) crystallizes in monoclinic system with centrosymmetric space group C12/c1. The internal structure analysis shows that the urea molecule with its unique ability forms hydrogen bonding network throughout the cocrystal system. Different orientations of the identified synthons form the networks via supramolecular connections such as C═O?H─O and C═O?N─H. Correlation between the internal molecular configurations in the unit cell, protruding molecular groups on different growth faces, and attachment energies of different crystal planes is studied. The Hirshfeld surface analysis shows that the higher percentage of overall interactions between the carbon and oxygen atoms at the outer surfaces of the cocrystal induces further incorporation of molecular aggregation and crystal growth. The 2D finger print plots infer that about 90.9{\%} of the overall interactions are mainly due to the H bonds. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis reveals that the grown cocrystal undergoes an observable phase transition at 105.65 $\,^{\circ}$C prior to its melting endotherm that peaks at 110.29 $\,^{\circ}$C.},

	abstract = {Cocoa beans contain antioxidant molecules with the potential to inhibit type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19). In particular, protease. Therefore, using in silico tests, 30 molecules obtained from cocoa were evaluated. Using molecular docking and quantum mechanics calculations, the chemical properties and binding efficiency of each ligand was evaluated, which allowed the selection of 5 compounds of this series. The ability of amentoflavone, isorhoifolin, nicotiflorin, naringin and rutin to bind to the main viral protease was studied by means of free energy calculations and structural analysis performed from molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/inhibitor complex. Isorhoifolin and rutin stand out, presenting a more negative binding ΔG than the reference inhibitor N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N~1~-((1R,2Z)−4-(benzyloxy)−4-oxo-1-{[(3R)−2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]methyl}but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide (N3). These results are consistent with high affinities of these molecules for the major SARS-CoV-2. The results presented in this paper are a solid starting point for future in vitro and in vivo experiments aiming to validate these molecules and /or test similar substances as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 protease.},

The effects of SNH on S. mutans planktonic cultures were assessed by growth curve assay. The effects of SNH on S. mutans biofilm and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) production were observed via crystal violet (CV) assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony-forming unit (CFU) counting assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was applied to investigate the regulatory effects of SNH on the expression of virulence genes of S. mutans. Checkerboard microdilution assay was performed to investigate the combinatorial effects of SNH with two common cariostatic agents. SNH acted as an inhibitor on planktonic cell growth, biofilm formation and EPS production of S. mutans. SNH also downregulated the expression of gtfBCD and comDE systems and exhibited synergism with chlorhexidine (CHX). In conclusion, this study indicated a possibility for SNH to become an anticaries agents by its antimicrobial activity and synergistic effects with CHX against S. mutans.},

	abstract = {Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has mobilized scientific attention in search of a treatment. The cysteine-proteases, main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are important targets for antiviral drugs. In this work, we simulate the interactions between the Mpro and PLpro with Ebselen, its metabolites and derivatives with the aim of finding molecules that can potentially inhibit these enzymes. The docking data demonstrate that there are two main interactions between the thiol (−SH) group of Cys (from the protease active sites) and the electrophilic centers of the organoselenium molecules, i. e. the interaction with the carbonyl group (O=C{\ldots}SH) and the interaction with the Se moiety (Se{\ldots}SH). Both interactions may lead to an adduct formation and enzyme inhibition. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with Ebselen indicate that the energetics of the thiol nucleophilic attack is more favorable on Se than on the carbonyl group, which is in accordance with experimental data (Jin et al. Nature, 2020, 582, 289--293). Therefore, organoselenium molecules should be further explored as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Furthermore, we suggest that some metabolites of Ebselen (e. g. Ebselen diselenide and methylebselenoxide) and derivatives ethaselen and ebsulfur should be tested in vitro as inhibitors of virus replication and its proteases.},

The model was used to screen new antitrypanosomal agents and predict the properties of composite molecules. <br></br> Methods: All compounds were randomly divided into a training set and a test set. A large number of descriptors were calculated by the software, then some of the best descriptors were selected to build the models. The linear model was built by the heuristic method and the nonlinear model was built by gene expression programming method. <br></br> Results: In the heuristic method, the correlation coefficients ,<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><sub>cv</sub>, <i>F</i> and <i>S</i><sup>2</sup> were 0.581, 0.457, 14.053 and 15.311, respectively. In gene expression programming, the R<sup>2</sup> and S<sup>2</sup> were 0.715, 10.997 in the training set and 0.617, 22.778 in the test set. The results showed that the relative number of S atoms and the minimum bond order of an H atom had a significant positive contribution to IC50. Meanwhile, the relative number of double bonds and the count of hydrogen-bonding acceptor sites had a great negative impact on IC<sub>50</sub>. <br></br> Conclusion: Both the heuristic method and gene expression programming had a good predictive performance. By contrast, the gene expression programming method fitted well with the experimental values and it was expected to be beneficial in the synthesis of new antitrypanosomal drugs.},

	abstract = {A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study was conducted using nineteen previously synthesized, and tested 1-aryl-6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines with proven in vitro activities against Plasmodium falciparum. In order to computationally design and screen potent antimalarial agents, these compounds with known biological activity ranging from 0.697 to 35.978 μM were geometry optimized at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level of theory, using the Gaussian 09W software. To calculate the topological differences, the series of the nineteen compounds was superimposed and a hypermolecule obtained with s¯ = 17 and 20 vertices. Other molecular descriptors were considered in order to build a highly predictive QSAR model. These include the minimal topological differences (MTD), LogP, two dimensional polarity surface area (TDPSA), dipole moment (μ), chemical hardness (η), electrophilicity (ω), potential energy (Ep), electrostatic energy (Eele) and number of rotatable bonds (NRB). By using a training set composed of 15 randomly selected compounds from this series, several QSAR equations were derived. The QSAR equations obtained were then used to attempt to predict the IC50 values of 4 remaining compounds in a test (or validation) set. Ten analogues were proposed by a fragment search of a fragment library containing the pharmacophore model of the active compounds contained in the training set. The most active proposed analogue showed a predicted activity within the lower micromolar range.},

Nanosilica and composites are characterized using adsorption, desorption, microscopic, spectroscopic, XRD, SAXS, and quantum chemistry methods. The 1H NMR spectroscopy (at 200-283K) and cryoporometry (T < 273K) methods have been applied to AM1/arginine differently wetted and mechanically treated. The wetted blends have been studied in the methane atmosphere without or with addition of chloroform-d. In mechanically treated wetted blends, arginine (initially crystalline) is nanostructured and amorphous. In the powders wetted at 0.1-0.5 grams of water per gram of dry solids, interaction energy of unfrozen water with nanoparticles depends nonmonotonically on the degree of hydration. The value of the free surface energy is maximal at the hydration of 0.3g/g. Bound water, which partially fills interparticle voids and may remain liquid or forms amorphous ice nanoparticles at lower temperatures, provides enhanced nanoporosity in wetted composites. This is appropriate for the methane adsorption up to 7.3-4.9wt.% at 199-283K.},

The introduction of un-natural residues and a lactam internal bridge, within SOCS1-KIR motif, produced candidates that showed high affinity toward JAK2 catalytic domain. By combining CD, NMR and computational studies, we obtained valuable models of the interactions of two peptidomimetics of SOCS1 to deepen their functional behaviors. Notably, when assayed for their biological cell responses mimicking SOCS1 activity, the internal cyclic PS5 analogues demonstrated able to inhibit JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and to reduce cytokine-induced proinflammatory gene expression, oxidative stress generation and cell migration.

	abstract = {As the ubiquitous active components in aquatic environment, low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) have great influence on the environmental behaviors of contaminants. This research was focused on the effect of different LMWOAs including 11 aliphatic acids and 7 aromatic acids on the photodegradation kinetics of tetracycline (TC), and the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. Results showed that TC photodegradation in the presence of LMWOAs fitted pseudo-first-order photolysis kinetics, and the observed photolysis rate constant (kobs) varied from 0.077 to 0.331 h-1. The QSAR model was developed by partial-least-squares (PLS) with using a sequential approach with 25 theoretical molecular descriptors. Four descriptors including ELUMO-EHOMO, ELUMO, CCR and Qmax were found to mechanistically and statistically affect kobs, and the standardized QSAR model was: The high cross validated regression coefficient (Qcum2, 0.898) and high correlation coefficient (R2, 0.908) indicated significantly goodness-of-fit and high robustness of the model. The predicted and observed values with high agreement in the defined applicability domain featured accuracy and feasibility of model. This work provided a robust predictive method for estimating the TC photodegradation in the presence of different structure LMWOAs.},

The optimal SVM model possesses the coefficient of determination R2 of 0.946 and root mean square (rms) error of 0.253 for the training set of 139 compounds; and a R2 of 0.872 and rms of 0.302 for the test set of 135 compounds. Compared with other models reported in the literature, our SVM model shows better statistical performance in a model that deals with more samples in the test set. Therefore, applying a SVM algorithm to develop a nonlinear QSAR model for skin permeability was achieved.},

	abstract = {Brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs) are formed during the disinfection process of water containing bromine ions, such as marine aquaculture water. Little attention has been paid to Br-DBPs with anthropogenic chemicals as precursors. This study summarized the sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) oxidation of three frequently used pharmaceuticals, including two antibiotics, norfloxacin (NOR) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and the growth hormone estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2). Transformations of the pharmaceuticals were found to be faster in marine aquaculture water than in distilled water. Several Br-DBPs and Cl-DBPs were identified for NOR, SMX, and E2. It was shown that the carboxyl group, piperazine ring, C3, and C8 atoms were the primary reaction sites on NOR. The aniline moiety and S-N bond were identified to be the reaction sites on SMX. The C2, C4, C9, and C16 atoms were the potential reaction centers on E2. Preliminary calculation by QSAR model indicated that the value of logKow significantly increased with an increase in the number of bromine atoms in the Br-DBPs. The results of the bioconcentration factors (BCF) analysis suggested that the bioaccumulation of Br-DBPs were greater than that chlorinated DBPs (Cl-DBPs) in distilled water.},

Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of compounds 1 and 3 showed that they possess densities of 1.675 and 1.670 g/cm3, respectively. The detonation properties of all the synthesized compounds were studied using computational software such as the LOTUSES, EXPLO 5, and EXTEC codes. The blast peak over pressure and blast impulse were determined for each compound. The thermal behaviour of the synthesized compounds was analyzed using TGA/DSC thermogram, and each compound was found to exhibit acceptable thermal stability. The performance of the synthesized compounds were found to be high and fit into the category of high-energy-density materials (HEDMs).},

	abstract = {The catalytic hydrogen transfer (CHT) cascade reaction between alcohols and nitro- compounds meets green chemistry yet involves high catalyst requirements. Herein, a hierarchical nano-pyramid structure, in which cobalt single atoms (Co SAs) are deposited on highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles supported by nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as Co-ZnO/NC), was designed and obtained through pyrolysis of ZnCo-ZIF. The catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance toward the CHT cascade reaction, achieving a high nitrobenzene conversion (94%), imine selectivity (97%), and turnover frequency (8.8 h-1). This nano-pyramid is a state-of-the-art non-noble-metal catalyst and is comparable to noble-metal catalysts. Experimental and DFT results revealed that the Co SAs supported on ZnO reduced the reaction energy barrier of hydroxyl dehydrogenation, the first and rate-determining step in this heterogeneous catalysis. Furthermore, Co-ZnO/NC exhibits good recyclability and universality. Our findings offer a new catalyst for Schiff base synthesis and aid understanding of the roles of Zn in ZIF-derived carbon catalysts.},

	abstract = {The β-glucosidase derived from microorganisms has attracted worldwide interest for their industrial applications, but studies on β-glucosidases from Oenococcus oeni are rare. In this paper, catalytic mechanism of a novel β-glucosidase BGL0224 of Oenococcus oeni SD-2a was explored for the first time by kinetic parameters determination, fluorescence spectroscopy and quenching mechanism analysis, molecular dynamics simulation. The results indicated that BGL0224 had universal catalytic effect on different types of glycoside substrates, but the catalytic efficiencies were different. Fluorescence quenching analysis results suggested that the quenching processes between BGL0224 and seven kinds of substrates were predominated by the static quenching mechanism. A reasonable three-dimensional model of BGL0224 was obtained using the crystal structure of E.coli BglA as a template. The analysis results of molecular simulation (RMSD, Rg, RMSF and hydrogen bonding) showed that the composite system `BGL0224-pNPG' was very stable after 40 ns. The catalytic process of BGL0224 acting on `p-Nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside' conformed to the double displacement mechanism. Two glutamic acid residues `Glu178 and Glu377' played a vital role in the whole catalytic process. Overall, this study gave specific insights on the catalytic mechanism of BGL0224, which was of great significance for developing its potential applications in food industry.},

	abstract = {In this study, we report binding free energy calculations of various drugs-of-abuse to Cucurbit-{$[$}8{$]$}-uril as part of the SAMPL8 blind challenge. Force-field parameters were obtained from force-matching with different quantum mechanical levels of theory. The Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling (REUS) approach was used with a cylindrical restraint to enhance the sampling of host--guest binding. Binding free energy was calculated by pulling the guest molecule from one side of the symmetric and cylindrical host, then into and through the host, and out the other side (bidirectional) as compared to pulling only to the bound pose inside the cylindrical host (unidirectional). The initial results with force-matched MP2 parameter set led to RMSE of 4.68 {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}text{\{}kcal{\}}{\}}/{\{}{$\backslash$}text{\{}mol{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}from experimental values. However, the follow-up study with CHARMM generalized force field parameters and force-matched PM6-D3H4 parameters resulted in RMSEs from experiment of {\$}{\$}2.65{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}1.72 {\{}{$\backslash$}text{\{}kcal{\}}{\}}/{\{}{$\backslash$}text{\{}mol{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, respectively, which demonstrates the potential of REUS for accurate binding free energy calculation given a more suitable description of energetics. Moreover, we compared the free energies for the so called bidirectional and unidirectional free energy approach and found that the binding free energies were highly similar. However, one issue in the bidirectional approach is the asymmetry of profile on the two sides of the host. This is mainly due to the insufficient sampling for these larger systems and can be avoided by longer sampling simulations. Overall REUS shows great promise for binding free energy calculations.},

@article{Pak:2021ws,
	abstract = {This study presents a simple approach in design of tripeptides as a competitive inhibitor for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR). HMGR is a major rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and therefore constitutes the target enzyme of an extensive research to discover new compounds focused on its inhibition. In previous studies, the two hypocholesterolemic peptides (LPYP and IAVPGEVA) were isolated and identified from soy protein. Based on these peptide sequences, a number of peptides were designed previously by using the correlation between the conformational flexibility and bioactivity. The design method that was applied in previous studies was slightly modified for the purpose of the current research and 5 tripeptides were designed and synthesized. Among the designed tripeptides, YIE showed the highest ability to inhibit HMGR. A kinetic analysis revealed that this peptide is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA with an equilibrium constant of inhibitor binding (Ki) of 0.23 $\pm$0.03 μM. This is an overall 700-fold increase in inhibitory activity compared to the first isolated LPYP peptide from soybeans. The obtained correlation between the observed and predicted inhibitory activities is good enough in spite of the fact that a different length of peptides was used in the presented design. Statistical analysis suggests that the proposed approach is acceptable in the design of tripeptides.},

	abstract = {There has been an increase in the use of non-animal approaches, such as in silico and/or in vitro methods, for assessing the risks of hazardous chemicals. A number of machine learning algorithms link molecular descriptors that interpret chemical structural properties with their biological activity. These computer-aided methods encounter several challenges, the most significant being the heterogeneity of datasets; more efficient and inclusive computational methods that are able to process large and heterogeneous chemical datasets are needed. In this context, this study verifies the utility of similarity-based machine learning methods in predicting the acute aquatic toxicity of diverse organic chemicals on Daphnia magna and Oryzias latipes. Two similarity-based methods were tested that employ a limited training dataset, most similar to a given fitting point, instead of using the entire dataset that encompasses a wide range of chemicals. The kernel-weighted local polynomial approach had a number of advantages over the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. The results highlight the importance of lipophilicity, electrophilic reactivity, molecular polarizability, and size in determining acute toxicity. The rigorous model validation ensures that this approach is an important tool for estimating toxicity in new or untested chemicals.},

	abstract = {A fundamental understanding of cyclodextrin-closo-dodecaborate inclusion complexes has become of great interest in supramolecular chemistry. Herein{,} we report a systematic investigation on the electronic structure and intramolecular interactions of perhalogenated closo-dodecaborate dianions B12X122− (X= F{,} Cl{,} Br and I) binding to α-{,} β-{,} and γ-cyclodextrins (CDs) in the gas phase using combined negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The vertical detachment energy (VDE) of each complex and electronic stabilization of each dianion due to the CD binding (VDE{,} relative to the corresponding isolated B12X122−) are determined from the experiments along α-{,} β-{,} γ-CD in the form of VDE (VDE): 4.00 (2.10){,} 4.33 (2.43){,} 4.30 (2.40) eV in X = F; 4.09 (1.14){,} 4.64 (1.69){,} 4.69 (1.74) eV in X = Cl; 4.11 (0.91){,} 4.58 (1.38){,} 4.70 (1.50) eV in X = Br; and 3.54 (0.74){,} 3.88 (1.08){,} 4.05 (1.25) eV in X = I{,} respectively. All complexes have significant higher VDEs than the corresponding isolated dodecaborate dianions with the VDE spanning from 0.74 eV at (α{,} I) to 2.43 eV at (β{,} F){,} sensitive to both host CD size and guest substituent X. DFT optimized complex structures exhibit that all B12X122− prefer binding to the wide openings of CDs with the insertion depth and binding motif strongly dependent on the CD size and halogen X. Dodecaborate anions with heavy halogens{,} i.e. X = Cl{,} Br{,} I{,} are found outside of α-CD{,} while B12F122− is completely wrapped by γ-CD. Partial embedment of B12X122− into CDs are observed for the other complexes via multi-pronged B-X···H-O/C interlocking patterns. The simulated spectra based on density of states agree well with the experiments and the calculated VDEs well reproduce the experimental trends. Molecular orbital analyses suggest that the spectral features at low binding energies originated from electrons detached from the dodecaborate dianion{,} while those at higher binding energies derived from electron detachment from CDs. Energy decomposition analyses reveal the electrostatic interaction plays a dominating role in contributing to the host-guest interactions for the X = F series partially due to the formation of O/C-H···X-B hydrogen bonding network{,} and the dispersion forces gradually become important with the increase of halogen size.},

The QSAR model was developed from the training set consisting of 57 compounds and then used the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) correlation coefficient to evaluate the prediction ability of the QSAR model. Used Artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) for comparing. The RMSE (root mean square error) values of LOOCV in SVR, ANN and MLR models were 0.44, 0.46 and 0.54. The RMSE values of prediction of external 18 compounds were 0.41, 0.39 and 0.54 for SVR, ANN and MLR models, respectively.

In every section, structures displaying higher NLO response are highlighted. The structural characteristics responsible for the enhanced the hyperpolarizabilities are: incorporation of N, N- dialkyl donor with --NO2 acceptor connected through the heterocyclic ring as a spacer; conjugation extension in the azo dyes with stilbene/styryl type structure; incorporation of strong acceptor 3-dicyanomethylene-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-1,1-dioxide in the structure.

However, due to the strong competing hydrogen evolution and extremely low solubility of N2 in aqueous systems, thermodynamic modulation at the catalyst level is insufficient, leaving the current performance still far from practical application. Here, we rationally control the diffusion of the reactants to obtain suppressed proton supply and greatly enhanced nitrogen flux using proton-filtering covalent organic frameworks, forcing a highly selective and active nitrogen reduction. In this proof-of-concept system, we achieved a high performance in the electrochemical ammonia synthesis (ammonia yield rate 287.2 $\pm$10.0 μg h−1 {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}rm{\{}mg{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}rm{\{}cat.{\}}{\}}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}, Faradaic efficiency 54.5 $\pm$1.1{\%}) using a traditional carbon-based catalyst.

	abstract = {The requirement for accelerated and quantitatively accurate screening of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra across the small molecules chemical compound space is two-fold: (1) a robust `local' machine learning (ML) strategy capturing the effect of the neighborhood on an atom's `near-sighted' property---chemical shielding; (2) an accurate reference dataset generated with a state-of-the-art first-principles method for training. Herein we report the QM9-NMR dataset comprising isotropic shielding of over 0.8 million C atoms in 134k molecules of the QM9 dataset in gas and five common solvent phases. Using these data for training, we present benchmark results for the prediction transferability of kernel-ridge regression models with popular local descriptors. Our best model, trained on 100k samples, accurately predicts isotropic shielding of 50k `hold-out' atoms with a mean error of less than 1.9 ppm. For the rapid prediction of new query molecules, the models were trained on geometries from an inexpensive theory. Furthermore, by using a $\Delta$-ML strategy, we quench the error below $1.4$ ppm. Finally, we test the transferability on non-trivial benchmark sets that include benchmark molecules comprising 10 to 17 heavy atoms and drugs.},

	abstract = {Various methods for morphological, textural, and structural characterization of polymeric, carbon, and oxide adsorbents have been developed and well described. However, there are ways to improve the quantitative information extraction from experimental data for describing complex sorbents and polymer fillers. This could be based not only on probe adsorption and electron microscopies (TEM, SEM) but also on small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryoporometry, relaxometry, thermoporometry, quasi-elastic light scattering, Raman and infrared spectroscopies, and other methods. To effectively extract information on complex materials, it is important to use appropriate methods to treat the data with adequate physicomathematical models that accurately describe the dependences of these data on pressure, concentration, temperature, and other parameters, and effective computational programs. It is shown that maximum accurate characterization of complex materials is possible if several complemented methods are used in parallel, e.g., adsorption and SAXS with self-consistent regularization procedures (giving pore size (PSD), pore wall thickness (PWTD) or chord length (CLD), and particle size (PaSD) distribution functions, the specific surface area of open and closed pores, etc.), TEM/SEM images with quantitative treatments (giving the PaSD, PSD, and PWTD functions), as well as cryo- and thermoporometry, relaxometry, X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopies (giving information on the behavior of the materials under different conditions).},

The title compound 1 can be considered a main metabolite of phase I in the metabolic pathway of camptothecin derivatives bearing the alkylamino substituent. Therefore, its pharmacodynamic properties are of interest. It was established by DOSY (Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy) that compound 1 forms a fairly stable molecular complex with a model nicked DNA decamer with affinity constant Ka 3.02 mM−1. The analysis of NOESY experiments revealed intermolecular cross peaks and mutual induced shifts on both interacting components allowing the conclusion that guest molecule 1 is stacking the nitrogen bases inside the nick. MD (Molecular Dynamics) analysis of four possible inclusions of 1 inside the nick allows establishing the detailed geometry of a complex. Two conformations are suggested as the ones best representing the results of molecular modeling reconciled with experimental NOESY results. The aromatic core of both structures is stacking the nitrogen bases in a nick facing the unbroken strand with ring A. The protons in ring E interact with ribose protons of edge bases of a nick. In conclusion, it can be asserted that SN38 derivative 1 can effectively bind the molecular target of Topo I enzyme and play a role as a Topo I inhibitor.},

	abstract = {To date, the `one bug-one drug' approach to antiviral drug development cannot effectively respond to the constant threat posed by an increasing diversity of viruses causing outbreaks of viral infections that turn out to be pathogenic for humans. Evidently, there is an urgent need for new strategies to develop efficient antiviral agents with broad-spectrum activities. In this paper, we identified camphene derivatives that showed broad antiviral activities in vitro against a panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses, including influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), Ebola virus (EBOV), and the Hantaan virus. The lead-compound 2a, with pyrrolidine cycle in its structure, displayed antiviral activity against influenza virus (IC50 = 45.3 µM), Ebola pseudotype viruses (IC50 = 0.12 µM), and authentic EBOV (IC50 = 18.3 µM), as well as against pseudoviruses with Hantaan virus Gn-Gc glycoprotein (IC50 = 9.1 µM). The results of antiviral activity studies using pseudotype viruses and molecular modeling suggest that surface proteins of the viruses required for the fusion process between viral and cellular membranes are the likely target of compound 2a. The key structural fragments responsible for efficient binding are the bicyclic natural framework and the nitrogen atom. These data encourage us to conduct further investigations using bicyclic monoterpenoids as a scaffold for the rational design of membrane-fusion targeting inhibitors.},

While educts and products of a chemical reaction may be known, transition state optimization is challenging as good guesses may be unavailable. Extending stationary point searches to the excited state leads to additional difficulties as several states may be close in energy, requiring efficient state tracking. Here, we report the implementation of pysisyphus, an external optimizer, that allows localization of stationary points not only in the ground state but also for excited state by providing several state-tracking algorithms. pysisyphus offers all necessary tools for calculating reaction paths, starting from the optimization of the reactants, running chain-of-states methods such as the nudged elastic band or the growing string method with subsequent transition state optimization, and a concluding intrinsic reaction coordinate calculation.},

	abstract = {Excessive UV solar radiation exposure causes human health risks; therefore, the study of multifunctional filters is important to skin UV protective ability and also to other beneficial activities to the human organism, such as reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for cellular damages. Potential multifunctional filters were obtained by intercalating of ferulate anions into layered simple metal hydroxides (LSH) through anion exchange and precipitation at constant pH methods. Ultrasound treatment was used in order to investigate the structural changes in LSH-ferulate materials. Structural and spectroscopic analyses show the formation of layered materials composed by a mixture of LSH intercalated with ferulate anions, where carboxylate groups of ferulate species interact with LSH layers. UV-VIS absorption spectra and in vitro SPF measurements indicate that LSH-ferulate systems have UV shielding capacity, mainly UVB protection. The results of reactive species assays show the ability of layered compounds in capture DPPH*, ABTS*+, ROO*, and HOCl/OCl− reactive species. LSH-ferulate materials exhibit antioxidant activity and singular optical properties that enable their use as multifunctional filters.},

In gas-phase benchmarks{,} where CCSD(T) and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods have been used as the reference{,} most of the (dispersion corrected) density functional approximations are accurate enough to justify prioritizing computational cost and compatibility with other modelling options as the criterion of choice. NMR experiments of 3′3′-c-di-AMP{,} 3′3′-c-GAMP{,} and 3′3′-c-di-GMP show the overall prevalence of the anti-conformation of purine bases{,} but some population of syn-conformations is observed for guanines. Implicit solvation models combined with quantum-chemical methods struggle to reproduce this behaviour{,} probably due to a lack of dynamics and explicitly modelled solvent{,} leading to structures that are too compact. Molecular dynamics simulations overrepresent the syn-conformation of guanine due to the overestimation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Our combination of experimental and computational benchmarks provides ``error bars'' for modelling cyclic dinucleotides in solvent{,} where such information is generally difficult to obtain{,} and should help gauge the interpretability of studies dealing with binding of cyclic dinucleotides to important pharmaceutical targets.

Their cooperation and stepwise activation include a process called cap-snatching, which is a crucial step in the IAV life cycle. Reproduction of IAV can be blocked by disrupting the interaction between the PB2 domain and the five-prime cap. An inhibitor of this interaction called pimodivir (VX-787) recently entered the third phase of clinical trial; however, several mutations in PB2 that cause resistance to pimodivir were observed. First major mutation, F404Y, causing resistance was identified during preclinical testing, next the mutation M431I was identified in patients during the second phase of clinical trials. The mutation H357N was identified during testing of IAV strains at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We set out to provide a structural and thermodynamic analysis of the interactions between cap-binding domain of PB2 wild-type and PB2 variants bearing these mutations and pimodivir. Here we present four crystal structures of PB2-WT, PB2-F404Y, PB2-M431I and PB2-H357N in complex with pimodivir. We have thermodynamically analysed all PB2 variants and proposed the effect of these mutations on thermodynamic parameters of these interactions and pimodivir resistance development. These data will contribute to understanding the effect of these missense mutations to the resistance development and help to design next generation inhibitors.},

@article{D0CP06472F,
	abstract = {Amino acids are recognized as significant components of atmospheric aerosols. However{,} their potential role in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is poorly understood{,} especially aspartic acid (ASP){,} one of the most abundant amino acids in the atmosphere. It has not only two advantageous carboxylic acid groups but also one amino group{,} both of which are both effective groups enhancing NPF. Herein{,} the participation mechanism of ASP in the formation of new particle involving sulfuric acid (SA)--ammonia (A)-based system has been studied using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) combined with the Atmospheric Clusters Dynamic Code (ACDC). The results show that the addition of ASP molecules in the SA--A-based clusters provides a promotion on the interaction between SA and A molecules. Moreover{,} ACDC simulations indicate that ASP could present an obvious enhancement effect on SA--A-based cluster formation rates. Meanwhile{,} the enhancement strength R presents a positive dependence on [ASP] and a negative dependence on [SA] and [A]. Besides{,} the enhancement effect of ASP is compared with that of malonic acid (MOA) with two carboxylic acid groups (Chemosphere{,} 2018{,} 203{,} 26--33){,} and ASP presents a more obvious enhancement effect than MOA. The mechanism of NPF indicates that ASP could contribute to cluster formation as a ``participator'' which is different from the ``catalytic'' role of MOA at 238 K. These new insights are helpful to understand the mechanism of NPF involving organic compounds with multiple functional groups{,} especially the abundant amino acids{,} such as the ASP{,} in the urban/suburban areas with intensive human activities and industrial productions and therefore the abundant sources of amino acids. Furthermore{,} the NPF of the SA--A-based system involving amino acid should be considered when assessing the environmental risk of amino acid.},

	abstract = {We report the synthesis and characterization of a fullerene-steroid hybrid that contains H(2) {\char64}C(60) and a dehydroepiandrosterone moiety synthesized by a cyclopropanation reaction with 76 {\%} yield. Theoretical calculations at the DFT-D3(BJ)/PBE 6-311G(d,p) level predict the most stable conformation and that the saturation of a double bond is the main factor causing the upfield shielding of the signal appearing at -3.13 ppm, which corresponds to the H(2) located inside the fullerene cage. Relevant stereoelectronic parameters were also investigated and reinforce the idea that electronic interactions must be considered to develop studies on chemical-biological interactions. A molecular docking simulation predicted that the binding energy values for the protease-hybrid complexes were -9.9 kcal/mol and -13.5 kcal/mol for PL(pro) and 3CL(pro) respectively, indicating the potential use of the synthesized steroid-H(2) {\char64}C(60) as anti-SARS-Cov-2 agent.},

	abstract = {Triboelectric charging can strongly influence bulk powder flow behaviour, and hence its characterization is of great interest for safe manufacturing operations. In a recent development, the use of an aerodynamic disperser, employing a pressure pulse to disperse a small powder quantity, shows a great potential for inducing triboelectric charge transfer. We analyse this process by coupled Discrete Element Method and Computational Fluid Dynamics (DEM-CFD) simulations, incorporating triboelectric charge transfer. The simulations are based on property data of glass ballotini as model particles, together with those of α-lactose monohydrate (α-LM) and aspirin, as powders of practical interest. The characteristics of particle-particle and particle-wall collisions are analysed in detail. The analysis shows that pharmaceutical particles charge significantly more than glass ballotini. The charge-to-surface area ratio is remarkably constant and close to its equilibrium value for each test material. Overall, the analysis provides a great insight on the triboelectric charging by aerodynamic dispersion.},

Subsequently, the five new spirochromeno-quinolines and nine quinolines previously published by us (14 modified tacrine scaffolds) were subjected to AChE and BChE inhibitory activity evaluation. The molecule containing a spirocyclopentane derivative had the highest AChE and BChE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 3.60 and 4.40 μM, respectively), and in general, the non-halogenated compounds were better inhibitors of AChE and BChE than the halogenated molecules. However, the inhibitory potency of compounds 3a-n was weaker than that of tacrine. By molecular docking simulations, it was found that the size of the spirocarbocyclic moieties is inversely proportional to the inhibitory activity of the cholinesterases, probably because an increase in the size of the spirocyclic component sterically hindered the interaction of tacrine derivatives with the active site of tested cholinesterases. The findings obtained here may help in the design and development of new anticholinesterase drugs.},

Although strategies to minimize the blood-immune response with the coating surface of these biomaterials are being developed, many of the specific factors that trigger this immune response are still unknown. Among the approaches to overcome this situation, the surface modification by zwitterionic molecules is promising due to their recognized biocompatibility and anti-fouling properties. Here we present a computational study on the structural, electronic, and reactivity properties of a series of anti-fouling zwitterionic molecules containing sulfobetaine, carboxybetaine and phosphorylcholine groups with distinct anchoring segments. Details on the adsorption and anchoring of these molecules on SiO2 model systems as well as their interaction with water molecules were investigated. The results indicate that the evaluation of local softness matching can bring valuable information regarding the anchoring processes and stability of zwitterionic molecules. In addition, it is shown that the analysis of the frontier levels of the compound's components defines an effective and cheap approach for the proposition and identification of new/improved systems.},

	abstract = {With an ever-increasing number of synthetic chemicals being manufactured, it is unrealistic to expect that they will all be subjected to comprehensive and effective risk assessment. A shift from conventional animal testing to computer-aided methods is therefore an important step towards advancing the environmental risk assessments of chemicals. The aims of this study are two-fold: firstly, it examines the relationships between structural and physicochemical features of a diverse set of organic chemicals, and their acute aquatic toxicity towards Daphnia magna and Oryzias latipes using a classification tree approach. Secondly, it compares the efficiency and accuracy of the predictions of two modeling schemes: local models that are inherently restricted to a smaller subset of structurally-related substances, and a global model that covers a wider chemical space and a number of modes of toxic action. The classification tree-based models differentiate the organic chemicals into either 'highly toxic' or 'low to non-toxic' classes, based on internal and external validation criteria. These mechanistically-driven models, which demonstrate good performance, reveal that the key factors driving acute aquatic toxicity are lipophilicity, electrophilic reactivity, molecular polarizability and size. A comparative analysis of the performance of the two modeling schemes indicates that the local models, trained on homogeneous data sets, are less error prone, and therefore superior to the global model. Although the global models showed worse performance metrics compared to the local ones, their applicability domain is much wider, thereby significantly increasing their usefulness in practical applications for regulatory purposes. This demonstrates their advantage over local models and shows they are an invaluable tool for modeling heterogeneous chemical data sets.},

	abstract = {Surface oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) at different sites of carbonaceous materials showed different effects on the normalized monolayer adsorption capacity (QBET/A) obtained from the modified BET model. The OFGs on mesoporous surfaces inhibited the adsorption via the water competition, whereas those on the external surface promoted the adsorption due to the enhanced hydrophobic driving force and electrostatic forces, as analyzed from the adsorption molar free energy. Multiple linear relationships were established between the monolayer adsorption capacity QBET/A and the amounts of OFGs on mesoporous and the external surfaces ([O]meso and [O]external, respectively). The properties of aromatic adsorbate compounds, the polar area radio of aromatic molecule to water (PAad/w), and the log Kow together influenced the inhibition or promotion effects of OFGs. These results would allow predictions of adsorption behavior of aromatic compounds on carbonaceous materials on the basis of OFGs parameters. Theoretical calculations and simulations projected the configuration of aromatic molecules being parallel to the graphene sheets of carbonaceous materials. The symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) energy decomposition showed that the electrostatic forces intensified with the increase of adsorbate polarity. These analyses revealed that the electrostatic forces were enhanced in the presence of OFGs and that the π-π EDA (electron donor-acceptor) was the main force.},

The complex displays typical red Eu(iii) emission when excited at 345 nm. However{,} it also shows green emission when excited at 464 nm and{,} thus could be an interesting candidate for full colour display applications. The change in the colour could be a result of the high value of the energy back-transfer rate (6.73 × 105 s−1) from the triplet state of the organometallic chromophore to the 5D1 state of Eu(iii). Judd--Ofelt (J--O) intensity parameters (Ω2 and Ω4){,} radiative (AR){,} non-radiative (AR) decay rates and intrinsic quantum yield (QEuEu) have been calculated.},

	abstract = {Flat molecules like phenanthroline derivatives intercalate between base pairs of deoxyribonucleic acid and produce cytotoxic effects against tumoral cells. Elucidating the way of intercalation and its modulation on their efficiency by substitution still remains a challenging topic of research. In this work we analysed the intercalation via the major groove of methylated derivatives of phenanthroline{,} in different number and position{,} between guanine--cytosine base pairs. We studied our systems by using semi-empirical methods and density functional theory including dispersion corrections with the PM6-DH2 Hamiltonian and the B3LYP-D3 functional. We explored the geometry and electronic structure by means of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and non-covalent interactions index analyses{,} whereas the interaction energy was estimated by means of two different approaches: one taking into account the results from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules analysis and the other based on the so-called energy decomposition analysis. The effect of solvation was also taken into consideration. Our studies show that CH/π and CH/n interactions by means of the --CH3 groups of methylated phen follow a clear pattern for any number of --CH3 groups and their position in the methylated phen ligand. That is{,} they try to produce the CH/π and CH/n interactions with the O and N heteroatoms of the base pairs and with the O atoms of the sugar and phosphate backbone. These findings suggest that the modulation of the intercalation of ligands that are able to form CH/π and CH/n weak interactions with the deoxyribonucleic acid is ruled not only by the number and position of the substitutions of the ligands but also by some key sites{,} which are the O and N atoms of the deoxyribonucleic acid in our analysed systems. It suggests some key and lock mechanism in which the interacting fragments fit like puzzle pieces in order to achieve the optimal interaction for the stabilization of the system. Interaction energies were calculated by using different approaches which converged to similar trends about the number and position of the --CH3 groups. The important weight of the CH/H interactions in the total interaction energy must be highlighted.},

	abstract = {The binding of PAHs with DNA to form PAH-DNA adducts is a crucial step in PAH-induced carcinogenesis. How functional groups affect this binding is largely unknown. Here, we observed that functional group substitutions strongly inhibited PAH-DNA binding. Additionally, --OH substitution has the most potent inhibitory effect as it causes the smallest change in the electrostatic surface potential. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular docking analyses demonstrated that PAH derivatives bind with guanine via intercalation and groove binding and then non-specifically insert into the major/minor grooves of DNA. Quantum chemical calculations suggested that hydrogen/halogen bonding may be essential in affecting the binding of functional group-substituted PAHs with DNA. It was further revealed that Log KOA and the PAH derivatives' melting points correlated significantly with binding affinity, implying that changes in the physicochemical characteristics are important factors. This study opens a new window for understanding the relationship between highly toxic PAH derivatives and genetic materials.},

The proposed algorithm comprises a combination of few steps. They include conformational search for reaction intermediate using the molecular mechanics (MMX) approach, based on the obtained conformation construction of structures of transition states and pre-reaction complexes, and calculation activation energies to further determine the probable reaction pathways. The proposed algorithm could be adopted for investigation of chemical and biochemical reactions of different types.

Conformational properties of intermediate (3) have been investigated using stochastic conformational search. From the 95 localized conformations within 10 kcal/mol of global minimum that have been obtained, 63 unique transition state conformations were generated and optimized by using the PM7 and M062X/6-31G(d) methods for accurate estimation of overall rate constant of reaction.

	abstract = {Hydrogen bonds (HBs) play a crucial role in the physicochemical properties of ionic liquids (ILs). To date{,} HBs between cations and anions (Ca--An) or between cations (Ca--Ca) in ILs have been reported extensively. Here{,} we provided DFT evidence for the existence of HBs between anions (An--An) in the IL 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazolide [HEMIm][HEIm]. The thermodynamic stabilities of anionic{,} cationic{,} and H2O dimers together with ionic pairs were studied using potential energy scans. The results show that the cation--anion pair is the most stable one{,} while the HB in the anionic dimer possesses similar thermodynamic stability to the water dimer. The further geometric{,} spectral and electronic structure analyses demonstrate that the inter-anionic HB meets the general theoretical criteria of traditional HBs. The strength order of four HBs in complexes is cation--anion pair > H2O dimer ≈ cationic dimer > anionic dimer. The energy decomposition analysis indicates that induction and dispersion interactions are the crucial factors to overcome strong Coulomb repulsions{,} forming inter-anionic HBs. Finally{,} the presence of inter-anionic HBs in the ionic cluster has been confirmed by a global minimum search for a system containing two ionic pairs. Even though hydroxyl-functionalized cations are more likely to form HBs with anions{,} there are still inter-anionic HBs between hydroxyl groups in the low-lying structures. Our studies broaden the understanding of HBs in ionic liquids and support the recently proposed concept of anti-electrostatic HBs.},

The sol--gel method was adopted for incorporating europium complex into silica matrix as [Eu-(L)3-phen]-silica and this method was proved to be highly effective and excellent approach for obtaining such lanthanide hybrid material. Another hybrid was prepared by incorporating complex into PMMA (polymethyl methyl acrylate), an organic polymer, transformed into flexible thin film. The structure of the [Eu-(L)3-phen] was elucidated using various spectroscopic techniques, moreover Sparkle model calculation were utilized for prediction of ground state geometry. The photophysical properties of pure complex [Eu-(L)3-phen] and its hybrids were studied in detail and compared. The incorporation of pure complex into PMMA is highly supportive to enhance the stability of complex as evident from enhanced luminescent intensity, intensity ratio value 6.52, longer lifetime value 842μs and higher quantum efficiency 77% over pure complex. The organic polymer PMMA is expected to interact well with europium complex via antenna effect. The use of such inorganic and organic entities for hybrid preparation purposefully overcomes the flaws of lanthanide complexes in terms of thermal stability and mechanical strength. The promising and fascinating properties of synthesized lanthanide hybrids are fruitful in material research.},

	abstract = {Benzaldehydes are components of atmospheric aerosol that are poorly represented in current vapour pressure predictive techniques. In this study the solid state (PSsat) and sub-cooled liquid saturation vapour pressures (PLsat) were measured over a range of temperatures (298--328 K) for a chemically diverse group of benzaldehydes. The selected benzaldehydes allowed for the effects of varied geometric isomers and functionalities on saturation vapour pressure (Psat) to be probed. PSsat was measured using Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS) and PLsat was obtained via a sub-cooled correction utilising experimental enthalpy of fusion and melting point values measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The strength of the hydrogen bond (H-bond) was the most important factor for determining PLsat when a H-bond was present and the polarisability of the compound was the most important factor when a H-bond was not present. Typically compounds capable of hydrogen bonding had PLsat 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those that could not H-bond. The PLsat were compared to estimated values using three different predictive techniques (Nannoolal et al. vapour pressure method, Myrdal and Yalkowsky method, and SIMPOL). The Nannoolal et al. vapour pressure method and the Myrdal and Yalkowsky method require the use of a boiling point method to predict Psat. For the compounds in this study the Nannoolal et al. boiling point method showed the best performance. All three predictive techniques showed less than an order of magnitude error in PLsat on average, however more significant errors were within these methods. Such errors will have important implications for studies trying to ascertain the role of these compounds on aerosol growth and human health impacts. SIMPOL predicted PLsat the closest to the experimentally determined values.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the protective effect and mechanism of action of combined use of rosmarinic acid (RA) and xanthan gum (XG) on the stability of anthocyanins (ACNs) in the presence of l-ascorbic acid (pH 3.0). The addition of RA and XG, alone and in combination, significantly enhanced the color stability of ACNs, and the combined use of RA and XG showed the best effect. FTIR, 1H NMR, AFM and computational molecular simulation analyses revealed that the improvement in ACN stability following the combined addition of RA and XG was due to intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. In the ACN-RA-XG ternary complexes, XG had stronger binding interactions with ACNs than RA. Our findings provide a valuable potential to enhance the stability of ACNs in the presence of ascorbic acid with the combined use of RA and XG.},

	abstract = {In this work, one-step electrochemical synthesis of a supercapacitor with high performance and stability based on carbon nitride and polypyrrole is described. The new composite was easily obtained through the electrodeposition of polypyrrole on the surface of carbon nitride using an aqueous suspension. This material was fully characterized using both theoretical studies and experimental techniques. The sample showed a capacitance value of 810 F g−1 (at 0.2 A g−1), retaining 92% of its initial value after 6000 charge-discharge cycles at 6.0 A g−1. Furthermore, the composite material has a capacitance value of 610 F g−1 at 9.0 A g−1. To explain these results, it was used impedance spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The computational calculations showed the formation of hydrogen bonds between the NH of the polypyrrole and the π-system of the carbon nitride which stabilized the structures. Besides, a planarization effect could also be observed over the polypyrrole chains. Both results are supported by the experimental data collected from the impedance experiments.},

Investigations of the formation mechanisms and structure of the above-mentioned FA complexes with bivalent metals [Cd(II), Cu(II), Mg(II), Ni(II), Pb(II) and Zn(II)] are presently an actual and trending topic in the modern chemistry of humic and fulvic acids. Furthermore, the importance of the theoretical DFT investigations of binding of metals with fulvic acids is stipulated by the lack of the relevant experimental structural data for such complexes. The quantum chemical calculations have shown that, of the four possible FA tautomers, the two FA forms are more stable. The wavefunction analysis and computed reactivity descriptors (electrostatic potential, Hirshfeld surface analysis, natural population analysis charges, and condensed Fukui indexes) give the insight on the properties and reactive ability of these two different forms of the FA. The computed thermochemical parameters of the ion-exchange reaction explain the metal binding affinity and selectivity of the FA forms.},

	abstract = {Conjugated polymers have been considered promising candidates for applications in chemical sensors, mainly due to their high versatility of synthesis, low cost, light weight, and suitable optoelectronic properties. In this context, polythiophene (PT) derivatives have been successfully employed. However, at the same time that the versatility of the synthesis allows the production of varied derivatives, the complexity of interactions with analytes hinders an efficient design of compounds with improved sensing properties. In the present report, electronic structure calculations were employed to identify promising PT derivatives for chemical sensor applications. Structural, optoelectronic, and reactivity properties of a set of branched PT derivatives were evaluated. Adsorption studies considering different gaseous compounds were conducted for selected systems. The results suggest that an appropriate choice of the side groups can lead to derivatives with improved sensorial properties. In particular, PT-CN derivative was identified as the most promising compound for high sensitive chemical sensors towards SO2 and NH3 analytes.},

	abstract = {The isomers of B12N12 nanocage with eighteen (Hn18) and sixteen (Hn16) homonuclear bonds have been proposed to capture/degrade the insecticide imidacloprid (Im). Calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) were performed to analyze the interactions and electronic properties of the B12N12-Im, Hn18-Im, and Hn16-Im systems at HSEh1PBE/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The large values of adsorption energy for the whole systems indicate that the interaction is mediated by chemisorption; therefore, these could be efficient to capture this insecticide. The latter effect leads to high geometrical modification for the Hn18-Im and Hn16-Im models due to one oxygen migrates from the nitroimine group of the imidacloprid, suggesting a new way to degrade the imidacloprid through the formation of radical species. On the other hand, the quantum parameters such as the electron affinity, ǀHOMO-LUMOǀ gap energy, and work function their values decrease in both gas and water phases, compared to systems unsaturated. Interestingly, these nanocages have great adsorption capacity even with five imidacloprid molecules attached to pristine cases, the interaction energy remains in the interval of chemisorption. Moreover, their high polarity indicates excellent solubility, property very convenient for the removal of this insecticide.},

	abstract = {Seven popular fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) in synthetic marine aquaculture water were subject to sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) disinfection scenario to investigate their reaction kinetics and transformation during chlorination. Reactivity of each FQ to NaClO was following the order of ofloxacin (OFL) > enrofloxacin (ENR) > lomefloxacin (LOM) > ciprofloxacin (CIP) ~ norfloxacin (NOR) >> pipemedic acid (PIP), while flumequine did not exhibit reactivity. The coexisting chlorine ions and sulfate ions in the water slightly facilitated the oxidation of FQs by NaClO, while humic acid was inhibitable to their degradation. The bromide ions promoted degradation of CIP and LOM, but restrained oxidation of OFL and ENR. By analysis of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), eight kinds of emerging brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs) caused by FQS were primarily identified in the chlorinated synthetic marine culture water. Through density functional theory calculation, the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) characteristic as well as the charge distribution of the FQs were obtained to clarify transformation mechanisms. Their formation involved decarboxylation, ring-opening/closure, dealkylation and halogenation. Chlorine substitution occurred on the ortho-position of FQs's N4 and bromine substitution occurred on C8 position. The piperazine ring containing tertiary amine was comparatively stable, while this moiety with a secondary amine structure would break down during chlorination. Additionally, logKow and logBAF of transformation products were calculated by EPI-SuiteTM to analyze their bioaccumulation. The values indicated that Br-DBPs are easier to accumulate in the aquatic organism relative to their chloro-analogues and parent compounds.},

A computational assessment of the mechanism and thermodynamics of the adsorption of 18 most common pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenofibric acid, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, phenazone, primidone, propranolol, salicylic acid, tramadol) on four different CNMs (pristine/functionalised graphene and carbon nanotube) in two different solvents (water and n-octanol) was provided. We show that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on pristine CNMs is controlled by dispersion forces, π-interactions and hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand, adsorption on functionalised CNMs is controlled by hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how functionalization of CNM, CNM curvature and background solution properties modulate the intensity of non-covalent interactions and their contribution towards adsorption free energy. With this knowledge, we pinpoint functionalised graphene at environmental pH as the most effective setting for the removal of a given set of pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater. Finally, we show that CNMs may transport pharmaceuticals into living organisms and release them in nonpolar mediums such as cellular membranes and fat cells.},

In this regard, by employing various spectroscopic, thermodynamic and imaging measurements we establish the generation, stabilization and in situ reaction of a novel supramolecularly supported emissive radical anions through host--guest interaction of N, {\'N}-bis[2-(2-aminoethyl)benzimidazolyl] naphthalene diimide (BzNDI) with Cucubit[n]uril (CB7 and CB8) macrocycles in aqueous medium. While the CB7 and CB8 hosts revealed distinct interactions with the BzNDI, the CB8 complexation displayed a novel excimer emission band in the 523 nm region, which originated from dimeric inclusion of BzNDI dyes in to the larger CB8 cavity. These CB7/CB8 stabilized BzNDI complexes undergo photoinduced electron transfer process to generate respective radical anions. These transient radical anions held in the cucurbituril nanocavities displayed characteristic emission spectra in the visible region and longer lived (τav ~ 6.5 ns) radical excited states and the radical anions are found to be reversible to their parent complex under ambient condition in ~1--2 h. This dynamic stability window of the radical anions has been used for the in situ reduction of Au3+ to generate stable AuNPs. It is noteworthy that this chemistry was not observed with BzNDI in the absence of CB7/CB8 host interaction. We foresee that the demonstrated stimuli responsive supramolecular approach has the potential for the controlled assembly of smart materials, radical polymerization, molecular electronics and other gated radical induced reactions.},

These results suggest that the medullary layer can catch all alkali cations in a wide pH range around the physiological one, while the upper cortex can effectively block penetration of metal ions when the metal stress grows. Such insights highlight a physiological role of metabolites like blocking of metal-cation migrations into intracellular tissues, and explain long-term retention of alkali cations including Cs in lichens containing enough such metabolites to bind them.},

	abstract = { The new coronavirus (COVID-19) is a viral disease that was classified as a pandemic situation on a global scale in early 2020. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)-2 has the enzyme Mpro, until then, best characterized as an important biological target for intracellular viral replication. To investigate the interactions between curcumins and other compounds derived from cinnamic acid with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease as well as to infer their physicochemical and drug-like properties, four natural curcumins and eight related compounds were selected for in silico screening, of molecular docking with the biological target Mpro, to suggest a therapeutic method associated with antiSARS-CoV-2 drugs, such as anakinra, azithromycin, baricitinib, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. All curcumins and related compounds can act as synergistic inhibitors of the main viral protein in SARS-CoV-2. The curcumins and other compound ligands showed similar interactions with the enzyme comparable to the control ligands. The ligands capsaicin, dehydrozingerol, dibenzoylmethane and isoeugenol stand out, due to their strong interactions. Among the compounds tested in this study, capsaicin, an alkaloid that is obtained from the fruits of plants of the genus Capsicum, showed significant activity in terms of its potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. },

Absorption UV--Vis properties of SCTz series were investigated and all derivatives absorb in the UV region and no are observed emission fluorescence in solution. The DNA-binding assays (UV--Vis analysis) showed that the all spiroderivatives demonstrated strong binding forces to CT-DNA. The Stern-Volmer quenching constants (KSV) of SCTz were calculated and derivatives containing the OCH3 group competed more strongly with DNA minor grooves, followed by the increasing general order of (KSV): EB-DNA < DAPI-DNA. Additionally, the high values observed for the bimolecular quenching constant rate (kq) indicated a static interaction between spiroderivatives and DNA in all cases. Finally, the HSA-binding experiments and molecular docking studies for the new spiroderivatives were determined and quenching (KSV) and quenching rate (kq) constants values obtained for the SCTz suggest good interaction between HSA and derivatives, probably by static mechanism, forming HSA:compound adduct in the ground state.},

	abstract = {Summary This chapter covers the emerging utilization of organocatalytic methodologies in industrial settings directed at the large-scale preparation of enantioenriched amines and N-heterocycles. First, some selected manufacturing processes, based on organocatalytic stereodetermining steps, are commented concisely. Despite the generally high catalyst loadings required, these examples show that the relatively low cost of organic catalysts makes the development of cost-effective industrial routes possible. Then, three case studies (pregabalin, the bicyclic core of telaprevir, and 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-isoxazolines) are discussed. These chiral targets have been approached through a variety of enantioselective strategies, among which the organocatalytic ones stand out for their versatility and potential for scale-up. Recent applications of organocatalysis in industrial settings are not restricted to a single activation mode or a class of catalysts. They encompass the whole catalyst and reaction repertoire typical of this relatively novel catalytic approach to asymmetric synthesis. Asymmetric organocatalysis proves to be, therefore, a useful and versatile synthetic tool for the industrial preparation of chiral compounds.},

Geometrical structures and scaled vibrational frequencies of all species and thermodynamic properties including standard reaction enthalpies ΔrH$\,^{\circ}$(T) and Gibbs free energies ΔrG$\,^{\circ}$(T) were calculated at a wide range of temperature from 298 to 2500 K at the B97D3/6-311++G(3df,2p)//B97D3/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. Consequently, the fluoranthene isomerization is initiated via two pathways, either by hydrogen 1,2-shift or carbon 1,2-shift reactions with reaction barrier of 356.6 and 393.6 kJ mol−1. Also, the co-existence of aceanthrylene and acephenanthrylene was observed with the corresponding ΔrH$\,^{\circ}$(0 K) of 28.5 and 53.7 kJ mol−1. Kinetic calculations for the initiative step confirm that in comparison with the carbon 1,2-shift mechanism the hydrogen 1,2-shift mechanism is always predominant. However, as shown by the kinetic calculations, these reactions are not relevant under flame conditions. It may need to find other reaction pathways explaining the conversion of these two intermediate species to pyrene.},

Such noncovalent interactions involving extended aromatic systems and water molecules are ubiquitous in a variety of chemical and biological systems. Our study provides spectroscopic results on simple model systems to understand the impact that an extended aromatic surface and the presence of a heteroatom have on the nature of the noncovalent interactions established with the solvent. Microhydrated phenanthrene and phenanthridine clusters with up to three water molecules have been observed and unambiguously characterised by means of broadband rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the backbone of phenanthridine remarkably affects the geometries of the water clusters and the interaction networks at play{,} with O--H···N and C--H···O interactions becoming preferred in the phenanthridine-water clusters over the O--H···π interactions seen in the phenanthrene-water clusters. The presence of this heteroatom induces nuclear quadrupole coupling{,} which was used to understand the cooperativity effects found with increasing cluster size. Our results provide important insight to draw a more complete picture of the noncovalent interactions involving solvent molecules and aromatic systems larger than benzene{,} and they can be significant to enhance our understanding of the aromatic-polar interactions at play in a myriad of chemical and biological contexts.},

	abstract = {Classical terpenoid biosynthesis involves the cyclization of the linear prenyl pyrophosphate precursors geranyl-, farnesyl-, or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GPP, FPP, GGPP) and their isomers, to produce a huge number of natural compounds. Recently, it was shown for the first time that the biosynthesis of the unique homo-sesquiterpene sodorifen by Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 involves a methylated and cyclized intermediate as the substrate of the sodorifen synthase. To further support the proposed biosynthetic pathway, we now identified the cyclic prenyl pyrophosphate intermediate pre-sodorifen pyrophosphate (PSPP). Its absolute configuration (6R,7S,9S) was determined by comparison of calculated and experimental CD-spectra of its hydrolysis product and matches with those predicted by semi-empirical quantum calculations of the reaction mechanism. In silico modeling of the reaction mechanism of the FPP C-methyltransferase (FPPMT) revealed a SN2 mechanism for the methyl transfer followed by a cyclization cascade. The cyclization of FPP to PSPP is guided by a catalytic dyad of H191 and Y39 and involves an unprecedented cyclopropyl intermediate. W46, W306, F56, and L239 form the hydrophobic binding pocket and E42 and H45 complex a magnesium cation that interacts with the diphosphate moiety of FPP. Six additional amino acids turned out to be essential for product formation and the importance of these amino acids was subsequently confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results reveal the reaction mechanism involved in methyltransferase-catalyzed cyclization and demonstrate that this coupling of C-methylation and cyclization of FPP by the FPPMT represents an alternative route of terpene biosynthesis that could increase the terpenoid diversity and structural space.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional grain growth behaviors under anisotropic (misorientation-dependent) grain boundary energy and mobility are investigated via phase-field simulations. Based on a multi-phase-field model and parallel graphics-processing unit computing on a supercomputer, very large-scale simulations with more than three million grains are achieved, enabling reliable statistical evaluation of anisotropic grain growth. The anisotropic boundary properties are introduced by the classical Read-Shockley and sigmoidal models; the threshold misorientation angle, Δθh, included in these models is used as a quantity to determine the anisotropy strength of the system. Systematic simulations are performed for different Δθh values, through which the correlations between the anisotropy strength and grain growth characteristics such as grain size and misorientation distributions are examined. The obtained results show that anisotropic grain growth reaches the steady-state regime irrespective of the Δθh value. However, the kinetics and microstructural morphology during the steady-state growth are largely dependent on Δθh. Furthermore, by comparison with the simulated results, the applicability of analytical grain growth theories to anisotropic systems are tested. The tests reveal that the steady-state microstructure in anisotropic growth cannot be well captured by the existing theories, which is likely because the basic assumptions of the theories do not hold for anisotropic systems.},

The new complexes derived from HAI and Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Eu(III), and Gd(III) were obtained in pure form. The obtained compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, UV--Vis, Fluorescence, 1HNMR, Mass spectra, DTA, TGA, Magnetic susceptibility, X-ray, AAS, and the conductivity of 0.001 M in DMSO. The obtained data indicated the formation of the target complexes: [Co(HAI)(H2O)(NO3)]NO3.4H2O, [Ni(AI)(H2O)2]Cl.2H2O, [Cu(AI)]Cl.H2O, [Eu(AI)(H2O)Cl]Cl.5H2O and [Gd(AI)(H2O)(NO3)]NO3.3H2O. The ligation sites were predicted from the guide of the FTIR and thermal analysis meanwhile the stereochemistry was proved by the UV--Vis and magnetic moment. Co(II) and Ni(II) gave an octahedral structure while Cu(II) gave a square planar form. Molecular modeling, molecular mechanics, and DFT calculations were carried out for the synthesized compounds.

The interactions of the synthesized complexes with FM-DNA moiety were investigated through spectrometric titration (UV--vis. spectra) and by using fluorescence spectroscopy. The modes and binding affinities were evaluated and discussed using Benesi--Hildebrand method. Antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds have been screened using the disc diffusion method. HAI and Cu-AI gave activity exceeded the Ampicillin.

	abstract = {A priority of modern agriculture is to use novel and environmentally friendly plant-growth promoter compounds to increase crop yields and avoid the indiscriminate use of synthetic fertilizers. Brassinosteroids are directly involved in the growth and development of plants and are considered attractive candidates to solve this problem. Obtaining these metabolites from their natural sources is expensive and cumbersome since they occur in extremely low concentrations in plants. For this reason, much effort has been dedicated in the last decades to synthesize brassinosteroids analogs. In this manuscript, we present the synthesis and characterization of seven steroidal carbamates starting from stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, diosgenin and several oxygenated derivatives of it. The synthesis route for functionalization of diosgenin included epoxidation and epoxy opening reactions, reduction of carbonyl groups, selective oxidation of hydroxyl groups, among others. All the obtained compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, HRMS, and their melting points are also reported. Rice lamina inclination test performed at different concentrations established that all reported steroidal carbamates show plant-growth-promoting activity. A molecular docking study evaluated the affinity of the synthesized compounds towards the BRI1-BAK1 receptor from Arabidopsis thaliana and three of the docked compounds displayed a binding energy lower than brassinolide.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report structural, electronic and optical properties of cubane (C8H8) and cubanoids (cubane-like molecules) using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The cubanoids are cubanes for which Carbon atoms have been substituted by Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Boron (B), Silicon (Si), Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb) or Bismuth (Bi) atoms. These molecules presented exceptional stability with several different symmetry point groups, being the majority Td. All calculated vibrational frequencies are positive for any studied molecules indicating that all these structures are in a stable state. The HOMO-LUMO gaps and DOS were calculated converged towards to values between 1.87 eV and 5.61 eV, actually showing promising electronic properties (Just for comparison, the cubane energy gap is 7.50 eV). The optical absorptions were also calculated for the cubanoid structure using the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT). Their dependence on the wavelength is analyzed, where five of theses structures absorb on the visible region. Finally, the extrapolation of thermodynamic properties indicates that these cubanoid could be potentially synthesized spontaneously, where four structures, the synthesis would occur for temperatures below 400 K, while for Si4Bi4H4 structure, the synthesis would occur at room temperature.},

We found that TFT performance with a Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> gate dielectric exceeds that with a HfO<sub>2</sub> gate dielectric. Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-gated TFTs with an In-Ga-Zn-O (In-Zn-O) channel show a saturation mobility of 57.1 (114.9) cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, effective threshold voltage of 0.9 (1.6) V, and subthreshold swing of 0.116 (0.256) Vdec<sup>-1</sup>. Based on a trap-limited conduction model, the improved performance correlates with the lower density of localized states in the tail and deep regions. A lower density of tail states leads to higher mobility, and the lower density of deep states tends to reduce both the threshold voltage and the subthreshold swing. Using semi-empirical quantum chemistry simulations, we show that the decrease in the number of localized states is associated with the inherent characteristics of Sm cations, due to their lower electropositivity and larger ionic radius compared to Hf, which leads to less ionic distortion in the channel.},

	abstract = {The protonated cyclo (LTyr-LPro) and cyclo (LTyr-DPro) dipeptides based on a diketopiperazine (DKP) ring are studied by tandem mass spectrometry in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy results are interpreted with the aid of quantum chemical calculations and chemical dynamics simulations. All the conformers identified for each diastereomer, denoted c-LLH+ and c-LDH+, respectively, are protonated on the carbonyl group of the tyrosine. The most stable form has an extended structure with the aromatic ring oriented outside the DKP ring; it is stabilized by an OH+{\ldots}π interaction. Distinct IR signatures are obtained for the extended conformers of c-LLH+ and c-LDH+, which differ by the strength of the OH+{\ldots}π interaction, much stronger in c-LLH+. Less stable species with the aromatic ring folded over the DKP ring are kinetically trapped in our experimental conditions, but their IR spectrum is identical for c-LLH+ and c-LDH+. The main collision-induced dissociation products of the protonated dipeptides are analyzed using chemical dynamics simulations. More efficient CID is observed for c-LDH+, in particular for the formation of the iminium ion of tyrosine. In contrast to the monomers, the protonated dimers of c-LLH+ and c-LDH+ show identical IR spectra. This is explained in terms of a structure involving a single strong OH+{\ldots}O interaction between subunits not sensitive to the absolute configuration of the residues, i.e., from a folded protonated monomer to an extended neutral monomer.},

	abstract = {The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 mediates the efflux of several chemotherapeutic drugs, contributing to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in many cancers. The most promising strategy to overcome ABCG2-mediated MDR is the use of specific inhibitors. Despite many efforts, the identification of new potent and specific ABCG2 inhibitors remains urgent. In this study, a structural optimization of indeno{$[$}1,2-b{$]$}indole was performed and a new generation of 18 compounds was synthesized and tested as ABCG2 inhibitors. Most compounds showed ABCG2 inhibition with IC50 values below 0.5 µM. The ratio between cytotoxicity (IG50) and ABCG2 inhibition potency (IC50) was used to identify the best inhibitors. In addition, it was observed that some indeno{$[$}1,2-b{$]$}indole derivatives produced complete inhibition, while others only partially inhibited the transport function of ABCG2. All indeno{$[$}1,2-b{$]$}indole derivatives are not transported by ABCG2, and even the partial inhibitors are able to fully chemosensitize cancer cells overexpressing ABCG2. The high affinity of these indeno{$[$}1,2-b{$]$}indole derivatives was confirmed by the strong stimulatory effect on ABCG2 ATPase activity. These compounds did not affect the binding of conformation-sensitive antibody 5D3 binding, but stabilized the protein structure, as revealed by the thermostabilization assay. Finally, a docking study showed the indeno{$[$}1,2-b{$]$}indole derivatives share the same binding site as the substrate estrone-3-sulfate.},

Antifreeze peptides (AFPs), a healthy and effective cryoprotectant, have great potential as ice crystal growth inhibitors for a variety of frozen products. In this review, methods and technologies for the production, purification, evaluation, and characterization of AFPs are comprehensively summarized. First, this review describes the preparation of AFPs, including the methods of enzymatic hydrolysis, chemical synthesis, and microbial fermentation. Next, this review introduces the major methods by which to evaluate AFPs' antifreeze activity, including nanoliter osmometer, differential scanning calorimetry, splat-cooling, the biovaluation model, and novel technology. Moreover, this review presents an overview of the molecular characteristics, structure--function relationships, and action mechanisms of AFPs. Furthermore, advances in the application of AFPs to frozen food, including frozen dough, meat products, fruits, vegetable products, and dairy, are summarized and holistically analyzed. Finally, challenges of AFPs and future perspectives on their use are also discussed. An understanding of the production, structure--function relationships, mechanisms and applications of AFPs provides inspiration for further research into the use of AFPs in food science and food nutrition applications.},

Tanshinone IIA derivatives with a planar heterocycle structure may function as G4 stabilizers. We present an innovative case of imidazole-based tanshinone IIA derivatives (1--8) especially compound 4 that improve the selectivity and the binding affinity with G4 DNA and enhance the target tumor inhibition. Cellular and in vivo experiments indicate that the tanshinone IIA derivative 4 inhibits the growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis of triple-negative breast cancer cells possibly through the stabilization of multiple G4 DNAs (e.g., c-myc, K-ras, and VEGF) to induce DNA damage. Further investigation of the intermolecular interaction and the molecular docking indicates that tanshinone IIA derivatives have better selective binding capability to various G4 DNAs than to double-stranded DNA. These findings provide guidance in modifying the molecular structures of tanshinone IIA derivatives and reveal their potential to function as specific G4 stabilizers.},

	abstract = {Propylene oxide (PO) binding and ring-opening reaction with the bifunctional CO2/epoxide copolymerization catalyst, based on the Co(III)-salcy complex including two quaternary ammonium salts with n-butyl substituents (N+-chains) were investigated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and compared with the model systems without the N+-chains. The importance of the different possible stereoisomers and the stereoselectivity of these processes for (S)- and (R)-enantiomers of PO were considered. To explore the conformational space for the real catalyst, a complex approach, developed previously was applied. The calculations for the model systems directly demonstrate that PO-ring opening proceeds preferentially in trans catalysts' configuration and no participation of cis-β isomers is viable; nucleophilic attack at the methylene-carbon atom is preferred over that at methine-carbon atom. For the real bifunctional catalyst, with the (S,S)-configuration of cyclohexane, the results indicate a preference of (R)-PO ring-opening over (S)-PO ring-opening (ca. 6:5). Concerning stereoisomers resulting from the orientation of N+-chains in the real catalyst, different groups of structures participate in the ring-opening reaction for (R)-PO, and different for (S)-PO. The high population of nonreactive complexes of (R)-PO may be the key factor responsible for decreasing the activity of the analyzed catalyst in the epoxide ring-opening reaction.},

	abstract = {The present review is aimed at highlighting outlooks for cyclophanic 1,3-diketones as a new type of versatile ligands and building blocks of the nanomaterial for sensing and bioimaging. Thus, the main synthetic routes for achieving the structural diversity of cyclophanic 1,3-diketones are discussed. The structural diversity is demonstrated by variation of both cyclophanic backbones (calix[4]arene, calix[4]resorcinarene and thiacalix[4]arene) and embedding of different substituents onto lower or upper macrocyclic rims. The structural features of the cyclophanic 1,3-diketones are correlated with their ability to form lanthanide complexes exhibiting both lanthanide-centered luminescence and magnetic relaxivity parameters convenient for contrast effect in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The revealed structure--property relationships and the applicability of facile one-pot transformation of the complexes to hydrophilic nanoparticles demonstrates the advantages of 1,3-diketone calix[4]arene ligands and their complexes in developing of nanomaterials for sensing and bioimaging.},

	abstract = {The applicability of cetylpyridinium chloride for potentiometric titration of lipophilic anions has been studied. The specially developed cetylpyridinium-selective plasticized electrode has been used for the investigation of the mechanism of interaction between the cetylpyridinium cation and lipophilic anions, which obviously goes through the association reaction resulting in the formation of water-insoluble precipitates. The investigated 54 anions were placed in the selectivity row that strongly correlates with lipophilicity. Additionally, an attempt has been made to find a simple and reliable descriptor suitable for prediction of the value of the end point potential break and thus indicating the applicability of the described potentiometric method for determination of untested lipophilic anions of interest. It has been established that despite being well known lipophilicity estimators, molar weight, octanol--water distribution coefficient logP, logarithm of solubility logS, and hydrophilicity-lipophilicity index can not be separately used for directly predicting the end point potential break values. However, simultaneous analysis of the above descriptors by using the multiple linear regression technique has resulted in the development of a reasonable QSPR model for the estimation of the potential break values near the end point.},

The results of the kinetic study, i.e. pseudo-second-order (PSO) and Weber-Morris (W-M), suggest an intra-particle diffusion as a rate-limiting step. The semi-empirical quantum chemical calculations aided the analysis of the non-specific and specific adsorbent/adsorbate interactions and their contribution to the overall bonding mechanism. Membrane utility was confirmed by performing a bed column study. In general, three main environmental issues of the present study, biodegradability of the used membrane, desorption efficiency, and development of the technology for the effective effluent water treatment and safe disposal of by-products highly conform to the demand of integrated environmental management system applicability in practice.},

The ability of the newly synthesized compound to inhibit viral replication was evaluated by a viral cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay performed on MCR5 cells infected with one of the four human coronaviruses associated with respiratory distress, i.e., hCoV-229E, showing antiproliferative activity in the micromolar range (EC50 = 12.9 $\pm$ 1.22 µM), with a very low cytotoxicity profile (CC50 = 170 $\pm$ 3.79 µM, 307 $\pm$ 11.63 µM, and 174 $\pm$ 7.6 µM for A549, human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELFs), and MRC5 cells, respectively). Docking and molecular dynamics simulations studies indicated that 8 efficaciously binds to the intended target hCoV-229E main protease (Mpro). Moreover, due to the high similarity between hCoV-229E Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we also performed the in silico analysis towards the second target, which showed results comparable to those obtained for hCoV-229E Mpro and promising in terms of energy of binding and docking pose.},

The inhibition of phospholipase A2, coagulant, fibrinogenolytic, hemorrhagic and myotoxic activities induced by Bothrops pauloensis venom (Pb) was investigated. For this, we use samples resulting from the incubation of Pb with ISO in different concentrations (1:1, 1:5 and 1:10 w/w), we also evaluated the condition of treatment using ISO after 15 min of venom inoculation. The activities of phospholipase A2, coagulant, fibrinogenolytic, hemorrhagic and myotoxic induced by the B. pauloensis venom were significantly inhibited when the ISO was pre-incubated with the crude venom. For in vivo neutralization tests, the results were observed even when the ISO was applied after 15 min of inoculation of the venom or metalloprotease (BthMP). Also, to identify the inhibition mechanism, we performed in silico assays, across simulations of molecular coupling and molecular dynamics, it was possible to identify the modes of interaction between ISO and bothropic toxins BmooMPα-I, Jararacussin-I and BNSP-7. The present study shows that naphthoquinone isohemigossypolone isolated from the P. aquatica plant inhibited part of the local and systemic damage caused by venom proteins, demonstrating the pharmacological potential of this compound in neutralizing the harmful effects caused by snakebites.},

We compared the performance of computational chemistry methods, including the force field based molecular mechanics, semi-empirical quantum mechanics, density functional tight binding, and density functional theory, on the basis of their accuracy and computational cost in predicting the redox potentials of alloxazines. Various energy-based descriptors, including the redox reaction energies and the frontier orbital energies of the reactant and product molecules, were considered. We found that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of the reactant molecules is the best performing chemical descriptor for alloxazines, which is in contrast to other classes of energy storage compounds, such as quinones that we reported earlier. Notably, we present a flexible in silico approach to accelerate both the singly and the HTCS studies, therewithal considering the level of accuracy versus measured electrochemical data, which is readily applicable for the discovery of alloxazine-derived organic compounds for energy storage in ARFBs.},

	abstract = {Shale gas is a major component of the hydrocarbon economy, and there are abundant studies in related exploration and exploitation fields using simulations and experiments. In this paper, the kinetic processes of adsorption and displacement during shale gas exploitation are analyzed using enthalpy-driven and entropy-driven processes with molecular dynamics simulations and statistical mechanics analyses. First, the changes in symmetry of CH4 and CO2 adsorbed on the graphene surface are analyzed. The adsorption process is a spontaneous process, where the Gibbs free energy decreases. During this process, the gas molecular entropy and the enthalpy of the system decrease, which indicates an enthalpy-driven process. The changes in entropy and enthalpy of various gas molecules (CH4, CO2, N2, and H2O) during the adsorption process are obtained. Through comparing the entropy and enthalpy changes before and after the displacement of CH4 by the different displacement media (CO2, N2, and H2O). The CO2-injected displacement of CH4 is driven by both enthalpy and entropy, and the N2-injected displacement of CH4 is driven by entropy. However, H2O-injected displacement of CH4 is not a spontaneous process. It plays a certain displacement role by reducing the partial pressure of CH4. To clarify the detailed spontaneous processes, the entropy change and exothermic processes during the supercritical fluid displacement of shale gas are discussed; then, the differences in displacement efficiency of different supercritical fluids are explained. This study is useful for understanding the kinetics mechanism of adsorption and displacement of shale gas.},

	abstract = {Abstract Polymeric derivatives of itaconic acid are becoming increasingly more interesting for research and industry because itaconic acid is accessible from renewable resources. In spite of the structural similarity of poly(itaconic acid derivatives) to poly(methacrylates), they are much less reactive, homopolymerize only sluggishly by free radical polymerization (FRP), and are often obtained with low molar masses and conversions. This has so far limited their use. The reasons for the low reactivity of itaconic acid derivatives (including itaconimides, diitaconates, and diitaconamides) are combined steric and electronic effects, as demonstrated by the body of literature on the FRP homopolymerization kinetics of these monomers which is summarized herein. These problems can be solved to a large extent by using controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques, notably atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition and fragmentation chain transfer radical polymerization (RAFT). By optimizing the reaction conditions for the ATRP and RAFT of itaconic acid derivatives, in particular the reaction temperature, linear relations between molar mass and conversion are obtained in many cases, and homopolymers with high molar masses and reasonably narrow polydispersity indices become accessible. This review presents the state-of-the-art FRP and CRP of itaconic acid derivatives, and highlights functional polymers obtained by these methods.},

Fluctuations and Kirkwood--Buff integrals (KBIs) in the TFE--H2O mixture{,} quantitative descriptions of inhomogeneity{,} were determined by small-angle X-ray scattering investigation and compared with those in the aqueous solutions of other alcohols. The concentration fluctuation for the mixtures ranks as methanol < ethanol ≪ TFE < tert-butanol < 1-propanol{,} indicating that the inhomogeneity of molecular distribution in the TFE--H2O mixture is unexpectedly comparable to those in the series of mono-ols. On the basis of the concentration dependence of KBIs between the TFE molecules{,} it was found that a strong attraction between the TFE molecules is not necessarily important to induce helix conformation{,} which is inconsistent with the previously proposed mechanism. To address this issue{,} by combining the KBIs and the helix contents reported by the experimental spectroscopic studies{,} we quantitatively evaluated the change in the preferential binding parameter of TFE to melittin attributed to the coil--helix transition. As a result{,} we found two different regimes on TFE-induced helix formation. In the dilute concentration region of TFE below ∼2 M{,} where the TFE molecules are not aggregated among themselves{,} the excess preferential binding of TFE to the helix occurs due to the direct interaction between them{,} namely independent of the solvent fluctuation. In the higher concentration region above ∼2 M{,} in addition to the former effect{,} the excess preferential binding is significantly enhanced by the solvent fluctuation. This scheme should be held as general cosolvent effects of TFE on proteins/peptides.},

The results suggest that polymethine dyes can be properly modeled as cationic structures and non-conventional AM1/CIS and PM3/CIS approaches can describe the major optical features of these compounds, due a better description of the electron density on the carbon chains.

Further, their electrochemical data were used to evaluate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. Finally, Py1-4 were successfully employed as blue-light emitter in the construction of new ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ Py1-4/Al configured light-emitting diodes (LED), and the fabricated devices demonstrated stable blue electroluminescence behavior endorsing an effective electrons injection in the PLEDs.},

	abstract = {Aldehyde reductase (ALR1) and aldose reductase (ALR2) are both oxo-reductase enzymes of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily involved in several cellular processes. ALR1 plays an important role in colorectal cancer, lungs, and hepatic carcinoma, while ALR2 is involved in diabetic complications like retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy cataract. Both the enzymes take part in distinct physiological processes, however, share more > 70{\%} structural homology. This is the major cause behind the unachieved target selectivity of molecules that entered the development pipeline as ALR2 inhibitors. Chromene analogues have been widely explored for diverse biological activities, including antioxidant and diabetic complication prevention potential. For the identification of spatial fingerprints of target-specific chromene bearing ALR2 inhibitors over ALR1, Gaussian field-based comparative 3D QSAR models were generated on a dataset having ALR1 and ALR2 inhibitory activity. Both the ALR1 and ALR2 3D QSAR models were statistically fit with good predictive ability concerning PLS generated validation constraints. The comparative steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, HBA, and HBD features were elucidated using respective contour maps for selective target specific favourable activity against ALR2 over ALR1. In addition, the five-point pharmacophores for ALR1 and ALR2 favourable features were also generated using the DHHRR{\_}1 hypothesis for better insight on the distinctive features of ALR2 inhibitors compared to ALR1.},

	abstract = {The cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) protein family plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation, making it an excellent target for cancer therapy. In this work, a set of small molecules were identified as Cdc25 modulators by applying a mixed ligand-structure-based approach and taking advantage of the correlation between the chemosensitivity of selected structures and the protein expression pattern of the proposed target. In the first step of the in silico protocol, a set of molecules acting as Cdc25 inhibitors were identified through a new ligand-based protocol and the evaluation of a large database of molecular structures. Subsequently, induced-fit docking (IFD) studies allowed us to further reduce the number of compounds biologically screened. In vitro antiproliferative and enzymatic inhibition assays on the selected compounds led to the identification of new structurally heterogeneous inhibitors of Cdc25 proteins. Among them, J3955, the most active inhibitor, showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells, with GI50 in the low micromolar range. When J3955 was tested in cell-cycle perturbation experiments, it caused mitotic failure by G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrest. Finally, Western blotting analysis showed an increment of phosphorylated Cdk1 levels in cells exposed to J3955, indicating its specific influence in cellular pathways involving Cdc25 proteins.},

	abstract = {The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are chemotherapeutic drugs used for targeted therapy of various types of cancer. In literature, there is no existing universal chromogenic reagent used for development of spectrophotometric assay for all TKIs regardless the diversity of their chemical structures. This work discusses, for the first time, the experimental and computational evaluation of chloranilic acid (CLA) as a universal chromogenic reagent for developing a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay (MW-SPA) for TKIs. The reaction of CLA with seven TKIs was examined in different organic solvents of various dielectric constants and polarity indexes. The reaction resulted in an instantaneous formation of intensely purple coloured products with all the investigated TKIs. Spectrophotometric investigations confirmed that the reactions proceeded via the formation of charge-transfer complexes (CTC). The physical parameters (molar absorptivity, molar ratio, association constant and standard free energy) were determined for the CTC of all TKIs. Computational calculations for the relative electron densities on each atom of the TKI molecule and molecular modelling for the CTC were conducted, and the site(s) of interaction on each TKI molecule were determined. Under the optimized conditions, Beer's law correlating the absorbances of the CTC with the concentrations of TKIs were obeyed in the range of 5--500 µg/well with good correlation coefficients (0.9991--0.9998). The limits of detection and quantitation were in the ranges of 1.89--5.09 and 5.74--15.42 µg/well, respectively. The proposed MW-SPA showed high precisions as the values of the relative standard deviations did not exceed 2.01 and 2.45% for the intra- and inter-assay precision, respectively. The accuracy of MW-SPA was proved by recovery studies as the recovery values were in the range of 98.8--103.7%. The proposed MW-SPA was successfully applied for the determination of all TKIs in their bulk forms and pharmaceutical formulations (tablets) with good accuracy and precisions. The proposed MW-SPA is the first assay that can analyse all the TKIs on a single assay system without modifications in the detection wavelength. Additional advantages of the proposed MW-SPA are simple, economic, and more importantly have high throughput. Therefore, the assay can be helpful and beneficial for routine analysis of TKIs in their pharmaceutical formulations in quality control laboratories.},

Additionally, a dye bearing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene was synthesized, and compared to its unfused bithiophene analogue. When the number of thiophenes were two or more the light absorption properties was significantly better in the region 400--550 nm compared to the dye without a π-spacer. DSSC device testing revealed that the reference dye without a π-spacer gave the best overall performance producing a power conversion efficiency of 5.7% (JSC = 10.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.83 V, FF = 0.68), attributed to the superior VOC of this dye. The incorporation of one and two thiophenes resulted in a similar performance as the reference, while incorporation of larger oligothiophenes proved to be deleterious to DSSC-performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that the voltage drops and performance loss associated with these dyes are due to more facile recombination.},

	abstract = {New particle formation (NPF) is the main source of atmospheric aerosols, and amino acids have been detected as the important components of atmospheric particulate matter. However, the role played by amino acids with different functional groups in the initial events of nucleation remains unclear. In this study, the interactions of alanine (Ala) and serine (Ser), which differ structurally by one hydroxyl group, with sulfuric acid were studied at the M06-2X/6-311 + G (d, p) theory level. Structural and thermochemical analysis results show that in small clusters, the introduction of the Ser's hydroxyl groups leads to the synergistic effect, which promotes proton transfer and improves the stability of the clusters. With the increase of cluster's size, the synergistic effect gradually reduces, the introduction of hydroxyl groups hinders the formation of hydrogen bonds between amino and carboxyl groups of Ser molecules with sulfuric acid molecules, resulting in the steric effect, reducing the stability of the clusters. Atmospheric relevance analysis results show that the formation rates of the clusters are positively correlated with the concentrations of sulfuric acid and amino acid, but negatively correlated with temperature. The temperature dependence of (SA)m (Ser)m is lower than that of (SA)n (Ala)n (n, m = 1--2, n = m), indicating for small clusters, the synergistic effect improves the stability of the clusters and plays an important role in the formation rates. The formation rates of (SA)m (Ser)m are slightly lower than that of (SA)n (Ala)n (n, m = 3--4), indicating for large clusters, the steric effect reduces the stability of the clusters and the concentrations of amino acid and sulfuric acid, temperature have greater influence on the formation rates.},

	abstract = {In humans, cystatin C mediated amyloid aggregation is quite detrimental. It is deemed to actuate intra-cerebral haemorrhaging, stroke, paralysis and further, turns out to be fatal under exigent circumstances. Especially, the domain swapped dimerization of cystatin C is the pathogenic trigger that propels its amyloidosis. Targeting the protein at this initial pathogenic stage could be effective in arresting cystatin C amyloid formation and its eventual aggregation. In our current analysis, using a logically assertive coherent computational pipeline, we have proffered an efficacious peptide based therapeutic (due to its benefits over small molecules) against the domain swapped cystatin C amyloid like dimer (CCAD) pre-fibril. Wherein, the tripeptide, `LVN'has effectually decreased the average beta sheet content (a distinct pathogenic aspect of amyloids) of CCAD from 49 to 43{\%}. Findings from discrete molecular dynamics simulation through intramolecular hydrogen bond analysis, covariance matrix, free energy landscape and solvent accessible surface area have further substantiated that, upon interaction, LVN has steered CCAD from its distinct pathogenic behaviour. Besides, the thermal unfolding simulation indicated that due to LVN's confluence with CCAD, the phase transition of the complex to a flexible state from a rigid phase, occurs with a relatively lower temperature and energy, compared to peptide unbound pathogenic CCAD. Hence, the consistent findings from various computational tools anticipate that LVN tripeptide could be a potent promising candidate in mitigating cystatin C amyloid aggregation in humans.},

	abstract = { Catalysis using supported gold nanoparticles has attracted significant research interest due to their unique properties and potential that is directly related to their particle size. An efficient one-pot, three-component procedure is developed for the preparation of pyrimido[4,5-b][1,6]naphthyridin-4(1H)-one derivatives (4a--h) by cyclocondensation of 6-amino-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydropyrimidin-4(1H)-one (1), aromatic aldehydes (2), and 1-benzylpiperidin-4-one (3) in the presence of zeolite-nano Au as a green catalyst in ethanol at 80 $\,^{\circ}$C. The presented methodology has a number of advantages including a reusable catalyst, easy access, short reaction times, high yields, and an easy work-up. The nanogold catalyst is characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The structures of the prepared compounds are established by elemental analyses and spectral data (infrared, mass spectrometry, 1H, and 13C NMR). While molecular docking studies show that products 4a and 4c have binding affinities with the active site of CDKs. A bio-evaluation assay revealed that some of the products exhibit strong to moderate effects against proliferation of Huh7 in an in vitro model of human liver cancer cells as confirmed by morphological alteration. Compounds 4c and 4a offer the lowest IC50 values at 22.5 and 39 µM, respectively. },

Nowadays, the hidden zearalenone (ZEN) that binding with macromolecular zein has been found in maize. However, the binding mechanism of ZEN with zein in maize has not been clarified. In this study, the formation of ZEN-zein complex was investigated applying ultrafiltration, multi-spectroscopic and molecular modeling techniques. The steady-state and transient fluorescence analysis suggested the ZEN could interact with zein to form the complex driven by hydrophobic force and hydrogen bonds, which is in accordance with the molecular modeling studies. The conformational changes of zein induced by binding with ZEN were revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD). Elucidating the binding mechanism between zein and ZEN could help the development of detecting hidden ZEN and guarantee the safety of maize products.},

	abstract = { It is of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry to find therapeutic substances extracted from natural sources, which are abundant, obtained with low costs and presenting the antiviral potential for the treatment of Zika virus (ZIKV) and COVID-19. Tangeretin (TAN) is a citrus polymethoxyflavone from Citrus reticulata peel oil with known antiviral activities, whose physico-chemical properties are not reported. The present study aimed to investigate by a theoretical screening of electronic, structural properties and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters that characterize TAN as a therapeutic drug in the treatment and prevention of zika fever and COVID-19. The molecule reached its minimum energy-forming state of −795.85747kJ/mol and the HOMO and LUMO boundary orbitals reactivity descriptors suggest that the compound is stable and does not tend to be reactive in intermolecular interactions. The ligand connects to the NS1 ZIKV receptor with strong H-bond interactions, also connects with the NS5 ZIKV receptor in a competitive effect with the SAM inhibitor and acts in a supplementary effect with the N3 inhibitor and the BRT drug in the Mpro SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The properties of ADMET shows that the compound suffers few amounts of drug alterations because it inhibits the metabolic enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 and penetrates the central nervous system, without accumulation of drug residues in the blood or in the lumen in the gastrointestinal tract, without risk of toxicity to the patient. With the results obtained, it is possible to identify TAN as a promising pharmacological tool for the treatment and prevention of Zika fever and COVID-19. },

	abstract = {225Ac-based radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to become invaluable in designated cancer therapy. However{,} the limited understanding of the solution chemistry and bonding properties of actinium has hindered the development of existing and emerging targeted radiotherapeutics{,} which also poses a significant challenge in the discovery of new agents. Herein{,} we report the geometric and electronic structural properties of hydrated AcIII cations in the [AcIII(H2O)n]3+ (n = 4--11) complexes in aqueous solution and gas-phase using density functional theory. We found that nine water molecules coordinated to the AcIII cation is the most stable complex due to an enhanced hydration Gibbs free energy. This complex adopts a closed-shell 18-electron configuration (1S21P61D10) of a superatom state{,} which indicates a non-negligible covalent character and involves H2O → AcIII σ donation interaction between s-/p-/d-type atomic orbitals of the Ac atom and 2p atomic orbitals of the O atoms. Furthermore{,} potentially existing 10-coordinated complexes need to overcome an energy barrier (>0.10 eV) caused by hydrogen bonding to convert to 9-coordination. These results imply the importance of superatom states in actinide chemistry generally{,} and specifically in AcIII solution chemistry{,} and highlight the conversion mechanism between different coordination numbers.},

@article{CARSON2021120236,
	abstract = {When constructed out of two identical, dissymmetrical, bidentate ligands, square planar platinum(II) complexes may take the form of two isomers, with either `head-to-head' (HH) or `head-to-tail' (HT) orientations. These two isomers display a different footprint which may impact their respective ability to interact with natural biomolecules. Such a platinum(II) complex composed of two 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridine chelates has recently been reported as an excellent guanine quadruplex (G4) binder, with a crystal structure that reveals one binder on each G4 face. However the resolution of the nucleic acid crystal structure does not allow to definitively identify which isomer resides at the 5′ G4 end. This manuscript explores the energetic, kinetic and structural aspects of the isomerization between the HH and HT isomers, using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of energy and geometry, 1H NMR and UV--visible spectroscopies, and X-ray crystallography, with the assistance of the more labile copper(II) surrogate, and using an analogous CH-containing ligand as control.},

	abstract = {Abstract Solidagenone (SOL) is a labdane-type diterpenoid found in Solidago chilensis, a plant traditionally used to treat skin diseases, kidney pain and ovarian inflammation. In this study, the topical anti-inflammatory activity of SOL was evaluated using in vivo and in silico assays. Croton oil-, arachidonic acid (AA)- and phenol-induced ear oedema mouse models were applied in the in vivo studies. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were determined, as well as histopathological analyses were conducted. Interaction profiles between SOL and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), glucocorticoid receptor, estradiol-17-β-dehydrogenase and prostaglandin-E(2)-9-reductase were established using molecular docking. SOL significantly inhibited croton oil-, AA- and phenol-induced ear oedema (P < .001) at doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ear. The MPO and NAG activities and TNF-α, IL-6 and NO levels were decreased (P < .001). The histopathological data revealed that inflammatory parameters (oedema thickness, leucocyte infiltration and vasodilatation) were reduced by treatment with SOL at doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ear. The docking study showed that SOL interacts with COX-1 and prostaglandin-E(2)-9-reductase through hydrogen bonding, inhibiting these enzymes. These results indicate that SOL may be a promising compound for the treatment of cutaneous inflammatory disorders and has potential as a topical anti-inflammatory agent.},

	abstract = {Background: Bacterial infections are considered as one of the major global health threats, so it is very essential to design and develop new antibacterial agents to overcome the drawbacks of existing antibacterial agents. Methods: The aim of this work is to synthesize a series
of new fluoroquinolone-3-carboxamide amino acid conjugates by molecular hybridization. We utilized benzotriazole chemistry to synthesize the desired hybrid conjugates. Results: All the conjugates were synthesized in good yields, characterized, evaluated for their antibacterial activity.
The compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity using methods adapted from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Synthesized conjugates were tested for activity against medically relevant pathogens; Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27856)
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433). Conclusion: The observed antibacterial experimental data indicates the selectivity of our synthesized conjugates against E.Coli. The protecting group on amino acids decreases the antibacterial activity. The synthesized
conjugates are non-toxic to the normal cell lines. The experimental data were supported by computational studies.},

	abstract = {In-depth kinetic and column adsorption study for diclofenac, DCF, heavy-metal and oxyanions adsorption on highly effective amino-functionalized lignin-based microsphere adsorbent (A-LMS) is examined. The A-LMS was synthesized via inverse suspension copolymerization of industrial kraft lignin with the amino containing grafting-agent (polyethylene imine), and an epoxy chloropropane cross-linker. The batch adsorption results indicated process spontaneity and feasibility of a high removal capacity: DCF(151.13)>>Cd2+(74.84)>Cr(VI)(54.20)>As(V)(53.12)>Ni2+(49.42 mg g−1). The quantum chemical calculated interaction energies reveal stabilization of the A-LMS/DCF complex through the electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. The results from the pseudo-second order and Weber-Morris fitting indicate a fast removal rate; thus, column tests were undertaken. The single resistance mass transfer model, i.e. the mass transfer (kfa) and diffusion coefficient (Deff), shows pore diffusional transport as a rate limiting step. The fitting of the fixed bed column data with empirical models demonstrates the influences of flow rate and adsorbate inlet concentration on the breakthrough behavior. Pore surface diffusion modeling (PSDM) expresses mass transport under applied hydraulic loading rates, calculated breakthrough point adsorption capacities: Cd2+(58.1)>Cr(VI)(54.1)>As(V)(50.9)>>Ni2+(42.9 mg g−1)), without performing the experimentation on a full pilot-scale level, further confirms the high applicability of the A-LMS bio-based adsorbent.},

	abstract = {Levofloxacin (LEV) is a broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotic and widely used for human and veterinary treatment. Overuse of LEV leads to its frequent occurrence in the water environment. In this study, the transformation characteristics of LEV in water during the simulated chlorination disinfection treatment were explored. Fifteen major transformation products (TPs) of LEV were identified, and their plausible formation pathways were proposed. The reaction pathways were strongly dependent on pH condition, and LEV removal was relevant to free available chlorine (FAC) dose. Antibacterial activity of chlorination system was dramatically declined when FAC was more than 3-equivalent (eq) due to the elimination of antibacterial related functional groups. Genotoxicity of chlorination system increased more than 3 times at 0.5-eq of FAC and then decreased with increasing FAC dose, which were in accordance with the relative concentration of toxic TPs estimated by QSAR model. These results implied that the combination of bioassay, QSAR computation and chemical analysis would be an efficient method to screen toxic TPs under chlorination treatment. It is anticipated that the results of this study can provide reference for optimizing operational parameters for water disinfection treatment, and for scientifically evaluating the potential risk of quinolone antibiotics.},

The ligand and its metal complexes were physically incorporated into a water-based paint and flexographic ink formulation to study their antimicrobial properties and performances as metal-complex pigments. The results of their performance tests further enhanced their applications as pigments. The mechanical resistance of the prepared paint and ink was also studied to evaluate the possible drawbacks that were associated with the addition of the prepared pigments. Compared with the blank sample, the studies indicated that the physical incorporation of Cu complexes slightly enhanced the mechanical properties of the painted films (the gloss values, hardness, and adhesion) and printed paper (gloss, color strength [density], and abrasion resistance) according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Further, regarding the antimicrobial test, the obtained results can be represented according to the following activity order: the prepared ligand > Zn complex > Ce complex > Cu complex before or after the incorporations of the paint and ink.},

These compounds crystallize in the same Monoclinic P21/c space group, though the molecular packing is affected by the haloaryl group varying the final crystal structure. The para substitution of the halogen atom in the aryl ring influences a more pronounced electronic deficiency over the methylene bridge allowing the formation of intermolecular C‒H‧‧‧O hydrogen bonds in compounds 1 and 3. Additionally, in compound 2, the ortho substitution of an F atom, not only affects the electron density but also blocks this CH2 group with an intramolecular C‒H‧‧‧O hydrogen bond. Remarkably after the crystallization process, compound 3 crystallizes as a cocrystal with a 4-fluorobenzoic acid molecule obtained by hydrolysis of 3. This co-crystallization affects dramatically the total packing energies from values of -138.7/-135.2 kJ/mol for 1 and 2, respectively, to -229.7 kJ/mol for compound 3.},

	abstract = {The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA), a non-cellular lab-based assay, is extensively used to measure the permeability of pharmaceutical compounds. PAMPA experiments provide a working mimic of a molecule passing through cells and PAMPA values are widely used to estimate drug absorption parameters. There is an increased interest in developing computational methods to predict PAMPA permeability values. We developed an in silico model to predict the permeability of compounds based on the PAMPA assay. We used the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory with the Kovalenko--Hirata (KH) closure to calculate the excess chemical potentials of a large set of compounds and predicted their apparent permeability with good accuracy (mean absolute error or MAE = 0.69 units) when compared to a published experimental data set. Furthermore, our in silico PAMPA protocol performed very well in the binary prediction of 288 compounds as being permeable or impermeable (precision = 94{\%}, accuracy = 93{\%}). This suggests that our in silico protocol can mimic the PAMPA assay and could aid in the rapid discovery or screening of potentially therapeutic drug leads that can be delivered to a desired tissue.},

	abstract = {The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are chemotherapeutic drugs used for the targeted therapy of various types of cancer. This work discusses the experimental and computational evaluation of chloranilic acid (CLA) as a universal chromogenic reagent for developing a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay (MW-SPA) for TKIs. The reaction resulted in an instantaneous formation of intensely purple colored products with TKIs. Spectrophotometric results confirmed that the reactions proceeded via the formation of charge-transfer complexes (CTCs). The physical parameters were determined for the CTCs of all TKIs. Computational calculations and molecular modelling for the CTCs were conducted, and the site(s) of interaction on each TKI molecule were determined. Under the optimized conditions, Beer's law correlating the absorbances of the CTCs with the concentrations of TKIs were obeyed in the range of 10--500 µg/well with good correlation coefficients (0.9993--0.9998). The proposed MW-SPA fully validated and successfully applied for the determination of all TKIs in their bulk forms and pharmaceutical formulations (tablets). The proposed MW-SPA is the first assay that can analyze all the TKIs on a single assay system without modifications in the detection wavelength. The advantages of the proposed MW-SPA are simple, economic and, more importantly, have high throughput.},

	abstract = { G-quadruplexes have raised considerable interest during the past years for the development of therapies against cancer. These noncanonical structures of DNA may be found in telomeres and/or oncogene promoters, and it has been observed that the stabilization of such G-quadruplexes may disturb tumor cell growth. Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to folding and stabilization of these G-quadruplexes are still not well established, and they are the focus of much current work in this field. In seminal works, stabilization was observed to be produced by cations. However, subsequent studies showed that different kinds of small molecules, from planar and nonplanar organic molecules to square-planar and octahedral metal complexes, may also lead to the stabilization of G-quadruplexes. Thus, the comprehension and rationalization of the interaction of these small molecules with G-quadruplexes are also important topics of current interest in medical applications. To shed light on the questions arising from the literature on the formation of G-quadruplexes, their stabilization, and their interaction with small molecules, synergies between experimental studies and computational works are needed. In this review, we mainly focus on in silico approaches and provide a broad compilation of different leading studies carried out to date by different computational methods. We divide these methods into two main categories: (a) classical methods, which allow for long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and the corresponding analysis of dynamical information, and (b) quantum methods (semiempirical, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, and density functional theory methods), which allow for the explicit simulation of the electronic structure of the system but, in general, are not capable of being used in long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and, therefore, give a more static picture of the relevant processes. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biophysics, Volume 50 is May 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates. },

	abstract = {The 3CL-Protease appears to be a very promising medicinal target to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. The availability of resolved structures allows structure-based computational approaches to be carried out even though the lack of known inhibitors prevents a proper validation of the performed simulations. The innovative idea of the study is to exploit known inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro as a training set to perform and validate multiple virtual screening campaigns. Docking simulations using four different programs (Fred, Glide, LiGen, and PLANTS) were performed investigating the role of both multiple binding modes (by binding space) and multiple isomers/states (by developing the corresponding isomeric space). The computed docking scores were used to develop consensus models, which allow an in-depth comparison of the resulting performances. On average, the reached performances revealed the different sensitivity to isomeric differences and multiple binding modes between the four docking engines. In detail, Glide and LiGen are the tools that best benefit from isomeric and binding space, respectively, while Fred is the most insensitive program. The obtained results emphasize the fruitful role of combining various docking tools to optimize the predictive performances. Taken together, the performed simulations allowed the rational development of highly performing virtual screening workflows, which could be further optimized by considering different 3CL-Pro structures and, more importantly, by including true SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro inhibitors (as learning set) when available.},

	abstract = {Abstract Kigelia africana plant is widely used as a herbal remedy in preventing the onset and the treatment of cancer-related infections. With the increase in the research interest of the plant, the specific chemical compound or metabolite that confers its anticancer properties has not been adequately investigated. The ethyl acetate and butanol fractions of the fruit extracts were evaluated by 2-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay against four different cell lines, with the ethyl acetate fraction having inhibition concentration values of 0.53 and 0.42 μM against Hep G2 and HeLa cells, respectively. More than 235 phytoconstituents were profiled using UHPLC-TOF-MS, while more than 15 chemical compounds were identified using GC--MS from the fractions. Molecular docking studies revealed that physostigmine, fluazifop, dexamethasone, sulfisomidine, and desmethylmirtazapine could favorably bind at higher binding energies of --8.3, --8.6, --8.2, and --8.1 kcal/mol, respectively, better than camptothecin with a binding energy of --7.9 kcal/mol. The results of this study showed that physostigmine interacted well with topoisomerase IIα and had a high score of pharmacokinetic prediction using absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profiles, thereby suggesting that drug design using physostigmine as a base structure could serve as an alternative against the toxic side effects of doxorubicin and camptothecin.},

This study is a part of our laboratory research program on the development of extractant ligands, including DBDTP in extraction for the separation and purification of rare-earth elements (REEs), specifically Gd. Gadolinium has also been a part of the research program about its use in the synthesis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, for the diagnosis of various diseases. This chemical calculation research aims to analyze the effect of descriptors in the form of parameters of the physical-chemical properties of bond lengths, bond angles, and bond energies on the stability of Gd complex compounds with DBDTP derivative ligands. To get descriptors PM7 semi-empirical method was used, while for data analysis, Multiple Linear Regression Analysis was used, assuming the model error is normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance. Furthermore, data processing was done using SPSS software. This research was conducted by involving 28 DBDTP derivative ligands and using multiple linear regression analysis. The regression equation is Y ̂ = - 0.966 + 0.586 V1 - 0.014 V2 + 0.000 V3. From the resulted research data it was found that there are three findings, namely: (1) bond length and bond angle have a significant simultaneous effect on stability of Gd complex compounds with DBDTP derivative ligands; (2) bond length and bond angle have a partially significant effect on stability of Gd complex compounds with DBDTP derivative ligands; (3) bond length proved to have a significant dominant effect on stability of Gd complex compounds with DBDTP derivative ligands.},

This compound presented great cytotoxic potential in several cancer cell lines, and an increment in its activity can be achieved through complexation with cyclodextrins. In addition, the 6G complexation can modify its physical state from liquid to solid and mask its pungent taste, unpleasant for some people. The [6]-gingerol/β-cyclodextrin binary inclusion complex (6G/βCD) and [6]-gingerol/β-cyclodextrin/chitosan (6G/βCD/chitosan) ternary inclusion complex were successfully prepared in the solid state with the coprecipitation method, and characterized by 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Nuclear, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Scanning Electronic Microscopy and Molecular Modelling Studies. Analysis of phase solubility indicated that the inclusion complexes presented a B-type curve and stability constant values suitable for practical applications. NMR analysis, dissolution test and molecular modelling indicated that 6G can form total 1:2 inclusion complex with βCD, with the aromatic ring and alkyl chain of 6G located in the narrow side of the hydrophobic cavity of the two βCDs. The dissolution test showed a faster dissolution for inclusion complexes when compared to free 6G. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity activity of the 6G/βCD binary inclusion complex was examined to determine whether the bioactivities of 6G were affected by its inclusion. The cytotoxicity assays revealed that 6G/βCD had a slightly higher bioactivity than the free 6G, corroborating the slight increase in the solubility of 6G in the inclusion complex.},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs), a growing class of emerging pollutants in the environment, have attracted widespread attention due to their adsorption properties. Recent research on MPs has mainly concentrated on seawater, and little work has been conducted on freshwater. Investigating and predicting the adsorption behavior of organic pollutants by MPs are necessary in freshwater. In this study, the adsorption behavior of 13 organic chemicals by polyethylene (PE) and chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) MPs was determined under freshwater conditions. Results shows the majority of the organic chemicals exhibit no distinctive differences in their adsorption on two MPs. However, the adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorobenzene on CPE is obviously stronger than that on PE, and the result is a counter for two pesticides. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis was performed for the prediction of adsorption capacity. A QSAR model with acceptable performance (R2 = 0.8586) was built to predict the adsorptive affinity (expressed as logKd) of organic compounds on the PE MPs via multivariable linear regression (MLR) on forty-nine determined and collected data. The octanol/water partition coefficient (logKow) and excess molar refractive index (E) play dominant roles in the model. A QSAR model with satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.9302) was also established for logKd values from CPE MPs in freshwater by using 13 adsorption data determined. The logKow and most negative charge on Cl atom (Q-max,cl) play decisive roles in the adsorption. The findings can provide a scientific basis for the risk assessment of waters contaminated by MPs and organic pollutants.},

A systematic investigation of the fluorescence emission intensity of F-COC in various solvents reveals the gradual enhancement of the emission intensity as a function of the dielectric constant of the solvent; a maximum is observed for chloroform and this gradually decreases in solvents with a higher dielectric constant. The probable reason for the selective high emission of F-COC in chloroform solution or vapor is linked to the orientation polarizability of chloroform{,} which changes the F-COC molecular orientation. Computational modelling of the model structures illustrates that the optimized excited state energy as a function of the dielectric constant of the solvent deviates from the usual trend{,} and the specific role of hydrogen bonding interactions with chloroform was elucidated. Picric acid (PA) detection was studied using an F-COC fluorescence quenching technique in solution. The quenching was observed to be a static process{,} confirming that fluorescence quenching occurs in the ground state. Enhanced solid-state fluorescence arose from the complexation of F-COC with metal ions such as Zn2+ and Cu2+{,} as well as harmful Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions.},

The addition of 18-crown-6 (18C6) as a second additive imparted only slight improvement to the separation of all enantiomers. On the other hand, all three racemic amino acid mixtures demonstrated no indication of separation when the larger cavity cyclodextrin members, β- and γCD, are used as running buffer chiral additives. However, remarkable improvements in the separation of the enantiomers of phenylalanine and tyrosine were obtained when 18C6 is used together with βCD as a running buffer additive. Surprisingly, tryptophan enantiomers were not separated by the dual additive system of cyclodextrin and crown ether. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), all amino acids were found to form stable binary complexes with individual hosts as well as ternary compounds involving the crown ether and the cyclodextrin. Furthermore, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to build a clear picture about the interaction between the guest and the hosts. Most of these complexes remained stable throughout the simulation times, and the molecular dynamics study allowed better understanding of these supramolecular assemblies.},

	abstract = {Herein, we present an integrated computational and experimental study to tackle the interactions between recognized β-lactam antibiotics (cloxacillin and dicloxacillin) with the fibrinogen blood plasma protein. For this purpose, molecular docking simulation with elastic network based on collective low-frequency normal modes and perturbation response scanning maps were proposed to evaluate the conformational binding mechanism of fibrinogen under the unbound and bound states with the cited β-lactam antibiotics. Aiming to theoretically explore the hidden biochemical mechanisms and structural attributes leading failures in therapy success with β-lactam antibiotics. The computational results pointing that despite these conformational differences, both antibiotics exhibit very similar affinity-based free energies of binding as FEB (cloxacillin/E-region) = − 8.7 kcal/mol and FEB (dicloxacillin/E-region) = −7.7 kcal/mol. We theoretically suggest that the semi-synthetic incorporation of an additional halogen CL-atom in the dicloxacillin, respect to cloxacillin molecule, and its relative docking-pose orientation in the fibrinogen E-region could significantly reduce the appearance of potential fibrinolytic off-target effects usually associated to parenterally administered β-lactam antibiotics. Besides, the performed interactions diagrams revealed that the most relevant antibiotic binding interactions with the fibrinogen E-region (pocket 1) are mainly based on hydrophobic (C···C)-backbone-side-chain non-covalent interactions, acceptor/donor interactions with critical regulatory E-region residues SER50:Q > SER50:N associated to allosteric modulation based long-distance-based perturbations (dicloxacillin > > cloxacillin) in the E-region (Q-chain > N-chain) with remarkable conformational rigidification by decreasing the intrinsic collectivity, and leading different pattern of perturbations as allosteric signal propagation in the intrinsic conformational dynamics under bound state from both β-lactam antibiotics. An experimental validation was carried out by using calorimetric (ITC and DSC) and spectroscopic (Raman and fluorescence) methods. These methods corroborated the computational results, adding quantitative information to explain the binding process. Finally, the obtained results open new perspectives for the ``de novo rational drug-design'' of new derivatives of β-lactam antibiotics with high pharmacodynamic selectivity/specificity to avoid side-effects toward to achieve optimal benefit/risk rates beyond the antibiotic drug resistance phenomena, favoring the implementation of rigorous criteria for a more personalized antibiotic therapy.},

The interaction of tripod towards the lanthanides has been examined for thermodynamic equilibrium, photophysical behavior, and time-resolved luminescence measurements. Besides, a theoretically empirical method followed by quantum mechanical treatment of these chelates has also been summarized. A noticeable change in the electronic spectra of these complexes disclose CYTOM5OX as a pH-sensitive optical sensor for lanthanides detection; also, a strong green fluorescence allows simultaneous sensing in the visible region in a competitive medium. The intense fluorescence intermittently gets quenched under acidic and basic conditions due to photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer from the excited 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) moiety to the metal ion. The thermodynamically stable Ln3+ complexes in aqueous solution show stability constants in the range log β110 = 33--35 and pLn3+ in the range of 21--22. The hydration number that was predicted by the coordination scan was substantiated by lifetime measurements reveal presence of coordinated water molecules in Eu(CYTOM5OX) and Tb(CYTOM5OX) complexes.

Herein, we report that a less selective platinum catalyst becomes highly active and selective for industrially relevant hydrosilylation of a broad range of substrates when a porous cage ligand is used for confinement around the catalytic active site. The catalyst is more than ten times more active than Karstedt's catalyst while being recyclable. Properties such as size-selective catalysis and Michaelis-Menten kinetics support the proposed enzyme-like model. This biomimetic catalyst exhibits remarkable site-selectivity through the cage's confining effect, which amplifies small steric differences into dramatic reactivity changes for similar functional groups within a molecule.},

In this study, the ultraviolet photodegradation of asthma drug salmeterol (SX) and influencing factors were studied, meanwhile, the possible photolysis pathway and toxicity trends during the photolysis process were further discussed. The results showed that the photolysis of SX conformed to the pseudo-first order kinetic reaction and 1O2 dominated the photolysis process with contribution of 41.7 %. As the temperature, pH value and HCO3− concentration increased, SX photolysis rate accelerated. The presence of NO3− could also promote the SX photolysis rate but with to Cl2− the increase of NO3− concentration, the promotion reduced via OH quenching and stronger optical shielding. When Cl− concentration increased to 0.1 mM, the promotion effect of Cl− turned to inhibition due to the transformation of Cl to Cl2−. Moreover, the photolysis of SX was inhibited by the Fulvic acid (FA) through optical screening effect and free radical scavenging. Based on the nine intermediates predicted by UPLC-Q-TOF, three possible transformation pathways were proposed. Luminous intensity test of photobacterium phoshoreum T3 spp indicated the toxicity of the final reaction system was reduced through the ultraviolet irradiation.},

In this context, we herein report the molecular design, synthesis and characterization of two novel D-A-D-A-D architectured 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazoles, connecting the mono/dimethoxyphenyl substituted cyanovinylene sidearms symmetrically at 3rd and 6th positions of the carbazole heterocycle (CZ1-2), as potential hole-transporting materials (HTMs). The current work highlights their structural, photophysical, thermal, electrochemical and theoretical investigations, including their structure-property correlation studies. Evidently, the optical studies showcased their excellent fluorescence ability due to their push--pull natured structure with extended π-conjugation. Further, in-depth solvatochromic studies demonstrated their intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT)-dominated optoelectronic behavior, supported by various correlation studies. Also, the optical results revealed that CZ1 and CZ2 display λabs and λemi in the order of 410--430 nm and 530--560 nm, respectively, with a bandgap in the range of 2.5--2.6 eV. Finally, their quantum chemical simulations have provided an insight into the predictions of their structural, molecular, electronic and optical parameters. Conclusively, the study furnishes a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in the structural modification of carbazole-based HTMs for achieving better performance.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to gain an insight into the effects of mutation-induced binding pocket tilting of the Xyn11A xylanase from Bacillus firmus K-1 in producing a unique hydrolysis characteristic. In this study, the wildtype Xyn11A and its K40L mutant were compared for their hydrolysis patterns on beechwood xylan and xylooligosaccharides of sizes 2 to 6. According to our thin-layer chromatography experiment, the K40L mutant produced a larger amount of xylotetraose leftover than the wildtype. Kinetic determination of the WT and K40L mutant suggested that the higher X4 leftover on TLC was reflected in the decreasing catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) between enzyme and X4. The mechanisms underlying this efficiency loss were examined through atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD trajectory analysis showed that the mutation-induced binding pocket tilting resulted in an additional hydrophobic contact between the reducing end of X4 and Trp128. Meanwhile, the interactions between the non-reducing end and the Arg112 residue near the active site became lost, which could decrease the catalytic efficiency. This work suggested that the protein engineering to fine-tune the hydrolysis pattern for some desired xylooligosaccharide products was possible.},

This illness is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, a species that relies on a thiol-based metabolism to regulate oxidative stress. Trypanothione reductase enzyme plays a central role in the metabolic pathway of the parasite. In this work, a virtual screening of a library of novel thiadiazine derivatives against trypanothione reductase using molecular docking was performed. Four different series of hybrid ligands having in the structure one or two peptoid moieties (series I and II) or the tetrazole ring (series III and IV) were considered. An ad hoc numerical index called poses ratio was introduced to interpret the results of the docking analysis and to establish relevant structure-interaction relationships. In addition, six binding modes were found for the ligands with the highest populated conformational clusters after applying contact-based analysis. The most regular and relevant were binding modes I and II, found mainly for ligands from series I. A subsequent molecular docking on human glutathione reductase enzyme allowed to assess the possible cytotoxicity of the ligands towards human cells. A selective binding profile was found for ligands with interactions in the Hydrophobic cleft, the spermidine and the Z subsites inside the active site of trypanothione reductase. At the end of the study, new thiadiazine-based compounds were identified as plausible candidates to selectively inhibit the parasitic enzyme.},

DFT, molecular docking and urease inhibition studies revealed stability and electron withdrawing nature of 4 as compared to DNA base pairs and residues of urease. The DNA binding results from docking, UV-- visible spectroscopy, and viscosity studies indicated significant binding of 4 with the DNA via intercalation and groove binding. Further investigation of the compound was done on hepatocellular carcinoma; Huh-7 cell line as well as normal human embryonic kidney; Hek-293 cell line. The compound showed significant cytotoxic activity against Huh-7 cells in comparison to normal Hek-293 cells indicating selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Abstract A set of the characteristics calculated using any quantum chemical method can be attributed to local electronic structure, which may change for each atom in complex systems. Related average values can give poor characteristics because different atom fractions with different surroundings may have different electronic characteristics poorly corresponding to the average values. The aim of this work is to show that the distribution functions of atomic charges, as well as chemical shifts and molecular orbital energies, can be considered as a set of simple tools for easy analysis of complex systems within the scope of nonlocal characteristics describing whole systems. The approach efficiency and analysis adequacy depend on appropriateness of molecular and cluster models used. The systems with dozens or hundreds of molecules and solid nanoparticles of almost real sizes (>40 units, >2 nm) or calculated with periodic boundary conditions and expanded cells give more adequate nonlocal characteristics than much smaller systems with several molecules and small clusters (<10 units, <1 nm) can give.},

	abstract = {The aroma of peach fruit is predominantly determined by the accumulation of γ-decalactone and ester compounds. A previous study showed that the biosynthesis of these aroma compounds in peach fruit is catalyzed by PpAAT1, an alcohol acyltransferase. In this work, we investigated the key active site residues responsible for γ-decalactone and ester biosynthesis. A total of 14 candidate amino acid residues possibly involved in internal esterification and 9 candidate amino acid residues possibly involved in esterification of PpAAT1 were assessed via site-directed mutagenesis. Analyses of the in vitro enzyme activities of PpAAT1 and its site-directed mutant proteins (PpAAT1-SMs) with different amino acid residue mutations as well as the contents of γ-decalactone in transgenic tobacco leaves and peach fruits transiently expressing PpAAT1 and PpAAT1-SMs revealed that site-directed mutation of H165 in the conserved HxxxD motif led to lost enzymatic activity of PpAAT1 in both internal esterification and its reactions, whereas mutation of the key amino acid residue D376 led to the total loss of γ-decalactone biosynthesis activity of PpAAT1. Mutations of 9 and 7 other amino acid residues also dramatically affected the enzymatic activity of PpAAT1 in the internal esterification and esterification reactions, respectively. Our findings provide a biochemical foundation for the mechanical biosynthesis of γ-decalactone and ester compounds catalyzed by PpAAT1 in peach fruits, which could be used to guide the molecular breeding of new peach species with more favorable aromas for consumers.},

	abstract = {Gibberellins (GAs) play crucial roles in plant growth and development, and their regulatory functions rely on complex metabolic networks and signaling pathways. Therefore, the exploration of GAs metabolic network is of great importance. However, limited GAs have been found in given plant species, which makes it difficult to comprehensively study the GAs metabolic network. Herein, a structure-guided strategy for GAs screening based on liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry analysis assisted by chemical isotope labeling (CIL-LC-MS) was developed. In the proposed strategy, N,N-dimethyl ethylenediamine (DMED) and its isotopologue d4-DMED were used to label GAs. In light of the characteristic fragmentation patterns exhibited by the labeled GAs, four principles were summarized to screen the potential GAs from plant tissues. Subsequently, the MS/MS fragmentation behavior and qualitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) model were employed to assist in deciphering structures of GA candidates. With this strategy, thirty potential GAs were screened out and identified from five plant species. Seven of them were confirmed by the authentic standards. Twenty-two of them have not been reported before in the five plant species used in this study, including thirteen that have been reported in other plant species and nine that have never been reported in any plant species. Noteworthily, a total of nine potential GAs were speculated to be novel 16, 17-double hydrated GAs, which indicated that the 16, 17-double hydration may be a ubiquitous metabolic pathway of GAs in plants. This study was the first attempt to establish a structure-guided screening strategy for GAs. Our findings have enriched the GA species in plants and expanded the GAs family, which may be helpful for study of the metabolic pathway and physiological function of GAs.},

	abstract = {Isothiocyanates (ITCs) derived from Brassicaceae are potential food preservatives. Their antimicrobial ac-tivity is strongly influenced by their subclass and side chain. This is the first quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study of ITCs as antibacterials. Twenty-six ITCs covering 9 subclasses were tested against Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and growth inhibitory response (GIR) were determined and used to develop QSAR models. MIC of the most active ITCs was 6.3--9.4 μg/mL. The QSAR models were validated with leave-one-out cross validation. The proposed models had a good fit (R2adj 0.86--0.93) and high internal predictive power (Q2adj 0.80--0.89). Partial charge, polarity, reactivity, and shape of ITCs were key physicochemical properties underlying antibacterial activity of ITCs. Furthermore, ITC compositions and antibacterial activity of Sinapis alba, Brassica napus, B. juncea, B. oleracea, and Camelina sativa extracts were determined, after myrosinase treatment. B. oleracea ITC-rich extract showed promising activity (MIC 750--1000 μg/mL) against both bacteria. C. sativa ITC-rich extract showed promising activity (MIC 188 μg/mL) against B. cereus. The QSAR models successfully predicted activity of the extracts based on ITC compositions. The models are useful to predict antibacterial activity of new ITCs and ITC-rich mixtures. Brassicaceae ITC-rich extracts are promising natural food preservatives.},

	abstract = {Halobenzoquinones (HBQs) are emerging unregulated drinking water disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that are more toxic than regulated DBPs. This study aimed to determine the distribution and formation of HBQs in drinking water from water treatment plants in China, compare their chronic cytotoxicity and their induction of chromosomal damage in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and analyze the correlation of HBQ toxicity with their physicochemical parameters. Two HBQs, 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (2,6-DCBQ) and 2,6-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone (2,6-DBBQ), were detected in finished water and tap water in China. The concentrations were in the ranges of <2.6--19.70 ng/L for 2,6-DCBQ and <0.38--1.8 ng/L for 2,6-DBBQ. Chemical oxygen demand and residual chlorine were positively correlated with HBQ formation. The HBQ concentration was lower in a drinking water treatment plant using chlorine dioxide. High Ca2+ in tap water decreased the HBQ level. The rank order of HBQ by cytotoxicity was 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,3-diiodo-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,6-diiodo-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,6-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,5-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone > tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,3,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, and for their genotoxicity, 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,3-diiodo-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,6-diiodo-1,4-benzoquinone > tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,5-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,6-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone > 2,3,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone. The cytotoxicity of six dihalo-HBQs was negatively correlated with the octanol-water partition coefficient (r = −0.971, P < 0.05), molar refractivity (r = −0.956, P < 0.05), energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) (r = −0.943, P < 0.05), and polar surface area (r = −0.829, P < 0.05). The genotoxicity of these three pairs of dihalo-HBQ isomers followed the same order as their EHOMO values. This study reveals the occurrence and formation of HBQs in drinking water in China and systematically evaluates the chromosomal damage caused by nine HBQs in mammalian cells.},

Complicated and error-prone data analysis still remains a bottleneck, however, especially for identifying novel metabolites. Comparing experimental mass spectra to curated databases containing reference spectra has been the gold standard for identification of compounds, but constructing such databases is a costly and time-demanding task. Many software applications try to circumvent this process by utilizing cutting-edge advances in computational methods---including quantum chemistry and machine learning---and simulate mass spectra by performing theoretical, so called in silico fragmentations of compounds. Other solutions concentrate directly on experimental spectra and try to identify structural properties by investigating reoccurring patterns and the relationships between them. The considerable progress made in the field allows recent approaches to provide valuable clues to expedite annotation of experimental mass spectra. This review sheds light on individual strengths and weaknesses of these tools, and attempts to evaluate them---especially in view of lipidomics, when considering complex mixtures found in biological samples as well as mass spectrometer inter-instrument variability.}},

	abstract = {The red tree frog Litoria rubella from Australia has been studied for several decades showing that their dorsal skin glands secrete a number of small peptides containing a Pro--Trp sequence, known as tryptophyllin L peptides. Although peptides from many genera of Australian frogs have been reported to possess a variety of biological activities, the bioactivities of this peptide family have remained to be discovered. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant potency of a number of tryptophyllin L peptides for the first time using a joint statistical and experimental approach in which predictions based on Gaussian three-dimensional quantitative structure--activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models were employed to guide an in vitro experimental investigation. Two tryptophyllin tripeptides P--W--L (OH) and P--W--L (NH2) were predicted to have the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values of 0.80 and 0.87 μM Trolox/μM peptide, respectively. With those promising results, antioxidant capabilities of five tryptophyllin L peptides with the common core Pro--Trp--Leu were synthesized and subjected to 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical cation (ABTS˙+) radical scavenging assays. The tests indicated that all the tested tryptophyllin L peptides, noticeably S--P--W--L (OH) and F--P--W--L (NH2), are strong ABTS˙+ radical scavengers and moderate scavengers in the other two assays. The results, thus, suggested that the tryptophyllin L peptides are likely to be a part of the skin antioxidant system helping the frog to cope with drastic change in oxygen exposure and humidity, as they inhabit over a large area of Australia with a wide climate variation.},

	abstract = {We report the formation of self-assembled monolayers of a molecular photoswitch (azobenzene-bithiophene derivative{,} AzBT) on cobalt via a thiol covalent bond. We study the electrical properties of the molecular junctions formed with the tip of a conductive atomic force microscope under ultra-high vacuum. The statistical analysis of the current--voltage curves shows two distinct states of the molecule conductance{,} suggesting the coexistence of both the trans and cis azobenzene isomers on the surface. The cis isomer population (trans isomer) increases (decreases) upon UV light irradiation. The situation is reversed under blue light irradiation. The experiments are confronted to first-principle calculations performed on the molecular junctions with the Non-Equilibrium Green{'}s Function formalism combined with Density Functional Theory (NEGF/DFT). The theoretical results consider two different molecular orientations for each isomer. Whereas the orientation does not affect the conductance of the trans isomer{,} it significantly modulates the conductance of the cis isomer and the resulting conductance ON/OFF ratio of the molecular junction. This helps identifying the molecular orientation at the origin of the observed current differences between the trans and cis forms. The ON state is associated to the trans isomer irrespective of its orientation in the junction{,} while the OFF state is identified as a cis isomer with its azobenzene moiety folded upward with respect to the bithiophene core. The experimental and calculated ON/OFF conductance ratios have a similar order of magnitude. This conductance ratio seems reasonable to make these Co--AzBT molecular junctions a good test-bed to further explore the relationship between the spin-polarized charge transport{,} the molecule conformation and the molecule-Co spinterface.},

	abstract = {A novel class of hybrid solvents (mEIP:Tetz) comprising of N-methylated ethylene imine polymer (mEIP) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrazolate ([Emim][Tetz]) were developed for the highly efficient and reversible capture of SO2. The synergistic interactions rather than simple mixing between mEIP and [Emim][Tetz] were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Besides, it was experimentally demonstrated that mEIP:Tetz mixtures exhibited improved kinetics for SO2 absorption, and the production of viscous solids were completely eliminated, compared with using mEIP alone. More significantly, an exceedingly high solubility of 0.308 g SO2·g−1 absorbent in 2mEIP:8Tetz was received for trapping SO2 from simulated flue gas containing 2000 ppm SO2, which was much higher than most of the results reported in previous literatures under the same conditions. Finally, the absorption and desorption mechanisms were proposed according to the results of FTIR and 1H NMR analysis.},

Current lithium-ion battery (LIB) systems present an inherent safety problem stemming from the use of metal oxide cathodes, which are oxygen sources, and flammable electrolytes based primarily on organic carbonates. Herein we report a novel non-flammable electrolyte formulated by the addition of 30% wt. of methyltributhylphosphonium Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide [Bu3MeP][TFSI] ionic liquid (IL) to a standard electrolyte (SE, ethylene carbonate (EC): ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) 1:1 wt/wt) + 1M LiPF6). The good physicochemical properties of the IL, (i) mitigate the ignition delay and flammability of the proposed electrolyte and (ii) markedly improve the interfacial resistance of the LiMn2O4//Li and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2//Li half-cells. The half-cells' performance indicates that the conveyed hybrid electrolyte (HE) retains a higher portion of its energy density (629 vs. 446 Wh.kg−1 for HE and SE in an NCA//Li half-cell, accordingly). At 60$\,^{\circ}$C, [Bu3MeP] [TFSI] considerably improved the cathode performance in terms of capacity (up to 230 mAh.g−1 for NCA) and coulombic efficiency (>99%).},

	abstract = {Pollutants in real aquatic systems commonly occur as chemical mixtures. Yet, the corresponding risk assessment is still mostly based on information on single-pollutant toxicity, accepting the assumption that pollutant mixtures exhibit additive toxicity effect which is often not the case. Therefore, it is still better to use the experimental approach. Unfortunately, experimental determination of toxicity for each mixture is practically unfeasible. In this study, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for the prediction of toxicity of binary mixtures towards bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri were developed at three toxicity levels (EC10, EC30 and EC50). For model development, experimentally determined toxicity values of 14 pollutants (pharmaceuticals and pesticides) were correlated with their structural features, applying multiple linear regression together with genetic algorithm. Statistical analysis, internal validation and external validation of the models were carried out. The toxicity is accurately predicted by all three models. EC30 and EC50 values are mostly influenced by geometrical distances between nitrogen and sulfur atoms. Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of oxygen and chlorine atoms in mixture can induce the increase in toxicity. At lower effect levels (EC10), nitrogen atom bonded to different groups has the highest impact on mixture toxicity. Thus, the analysis of the descriptors involved in the developed models can give insight into toxic mechanisms of the binary systems.},

This work presents the process of introducing boron and fluorine atoms into the structure of the reduced graphene during hydrothermal reaction with boron fluoride tetrahydrofuran (BF3·THF). The described process is a simple, one-step synthesis with little to no side products. The synthesized materials showed an irregular, porous structure, with an average pore size of 3.44--3.61 nm (total pore volume (BJH)) and a multi-layer structure and a developed specific surface area at the level of 586--660 m2/g (analysis of specific surface Area (BET)). On the external surfaces, the occurrence of irregular particles with a size of 0.5 to 10 µm was observed, most probably the effect of doping the graphene structure and the formation of sp3 hybridization defects. The obtained materials show the ability to store electric charge due to the development of the specific surface area. Based on cyclic voltammetry, the tested material showed a capacity of 450--550 mAh/g (charged up to 2.5 V).},

Individual samples were also analyzed by ellipsometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, static water contact angle tests and atomic force microscopy to determine SAM quality.

	abstract = {Abstract This work investigates possible improvements in the accuracy of semiempirical quantum chemistry (SQC) methods for the prediction of standard enthalpy of formation (ΔfHo) through the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) with molecular descriptors. A total of 142 organic compounds with enough structural diversity has been considered in the training set. Standard enthalpy of formation for the selected compounds at the semiempirical PM3 and PM6 quantum chemistry methods is collected from literature and is calculated by using the semiempirical PM7 method in this work. The multiple stepwise regression is first used to screen effective molecular descriptors, which are highly correlated with the error terms of the standard enthalpy of formation compared with experimental values. The obtained seven effective molecular descriptors are then used as input set to establish three 7-11-1 neural network-based correction models to improve the accuracy of SQC methods. By using the developed correction models, the mean absolute errors for ΔfHo of PM3, PM6, and PM7 methods are reduced from 22.36, 18.60, and 17.27 to 9.86, 9.83, and 8.95, respectively, in kJ/mol. Meanwhile, the results of the test set show that the neural network does not have the problem of overfitting. Detailed analysis of the seven effective molecular descriptors indicates that the major source of the correction models is the electron-withdrawing effect. The developed ANN models for the three selected SQC methods provide an efficient method for the quick and accurate prediction of thermodynamic properties.},

	abstract = {New Particle Formation (NPF) is considered as the dominant source of aerosol particles, influencing the environment and human health tightly. In recent years, valine (VAL) has been identified in field detection in urban areas, which reveals that VAL may play an important role in participating in atmospheric nucleation. However, there have been no categorical reports explaining how VAL participates in the multi-component nucleation with precursor Sulfuric Acid (SA) and the atmospheric organic amine Dimethylamine (DMA) so far. In this paper, quantum chemical calculation and cluster kinetic simulation have been studied to research the nucleation mechanism of (SA)x(DMA)y(VAL)z (0≤x, y, z ≤ 3) system. Structural and thermodynamic analysis at ωB97XD/6-31++G(d, p) theory level and basis set shows that VAL could form various stable structures through hydrogen bonds with SA and DMA, and proton transfer in ternary structure enhances the stability of system. However, in the clusters of SA-DMA-VAL system with large numbers of molecules, there has been steric hindrance between molecules of cluster due to the high proportion of inactive groups in VAL, which insulates the further formation of hydrogen bonds. With regard to the distribution of Gibbs free energy on VAL-DMA grid, the energy decreases rapidly along the diagonal with VAL and DMA in different numbers of SA molecules, predicting possible nucleation path along the diagonal. Besides, there is a synergistic effect of VAL in system SA-DMA-VAL, and VAL tends to replace the role of DMA in the ternary system. Evaporation rate analysis indicates that the ternary system containing SA is more stable. The simulating formation rate of SA-DMA-VAL system compared with the CLOUD experiment at CERN shows that the nucleation potential of SA-DMA-VAL is superior to that of SA-NH3-H2O, but inferior to that of SA-DMA-H2O, inferring that VAL may show more potential in growth processes than the initial nucleation processes in the light of the specific value of formation rate.},

	abstract = {Background
In our previous study, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effect of Herpetospermum pedunculosum in cholestatic rats. A bioassay-guided study also led to the identification and isolation of a lignan, dihydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DA) from the seeds of H. pedunculosum.
Purpose
To investigate whether DA could alleviate cholestasis and determine the mechanisms underlying such action.
Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered with DA (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg) intragastrically once daily for 7 days prior to treatment with α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) (60 mg/kg). We then evaluated the levels of a range of serum indicators, determined bile flow, and carried out histopathological analyses. Western blotting was then used to investigate the levels of inflammatory mediators and the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), proteins involved in the downstream biosynthesis of bile acids, and a range of transport proteins. Molecular docking was used to simulate the interaction between DA and FXR. Cell viability of human hepatocytes (L-02) cells was determined by MTT. Then, we treated guggulsterone-inhibited L-02 cells, Si-FXR L-02 cells, and FXR-overexpression cells with the FXR agonist GW4064 (6 μM) or DA (25, 50 and 100 μM) for 24 h before detecting gene and protein expression by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively.
Results
DA significantly attenuated ANIT-induced cholestasis in SD rats by reducing liver function indicators in the serum, increasing bile flow, improving the recovery of histopathological injuries in the liver, and by alleviating pro-inflammatory cytokines in the liver. DA also increased the expression levels of FXR and altered the levels of downstream proteins in the liver tissues, thus indicating that DA might alleviate cholestasis by regulating the FXR. Molecular docking simulations predicted that DA was as an agonist of FXR. In vitro mechanical studies further showed that DA increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of FXR, Small Heterodimer Partner 1/2, Bile Salt Export Pump, Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 2, and Na+/taurocholate Co-transporting Polypeptide, in both guggulsterone-inhibited and Si-FXR L-02 cells. Moreover, DA enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of FXR, and its downstream genes and proteins, in L-02 cells containing an FXR-overexpression plasmid.
Conclusion
DA may represent an effective agonist for FXR has significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of cholestatic liver injury.},

@article{molecules26072098,
	abstract = {(1) Background: Data accuracy plays a key role in determining the model performances and the field of metabolism prediction suffers from the lack of truly reliable data. To enhance the accuracy of metabolic data, we recently proposed a manually curated database collected by a meta-analysis of the specialized literature (MetaQSAR). Here we aim to further increase data accuracy by focusing on publications reporting exhaustive metabolic trees. This selection should indeed reduce the number of false negative data. (2) Methods: A new metabolic database (MetaTREE) was thus collected and utilized to extract a dataset for metabolic data concerning glutathione conjugation (MT-dataset). After proper pre-processing, this dataset, along with the corresponding dataset extracted from MetaQSAR (MQ-dataset), was utilized to develop binary classification models using a random forest algorithm. (3) Results: The comparison of the models generated by the two collected datasets reveals the better performances reached by the MT-dataset (MCC raised from 0.63 to 0.67, sensitivity from 0.56 to 0.58). The analysis of the applicability domain also confirms that the model based on the MT-dataset shows a more robust predictive power with a larger applicability domain. (4) Conclusions: These results confirm that focusing on metabolic trees represents a convenient approach to increase data accuracy by reducing the false negative cases. The encouraging performances shown by the models developed by the MT-dataset invites to use of MetaTREE for predictive studies in the field of xenobiotic metabolism.},

	abstract = {Earlier, we reported our finding of the fluorescence emission derived from the triple-deprotonated form of curcumin (Cur3--) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence of NaOH. Herein, we disclose the results of the studies on the luminescent properties of Cur3-- in the presence of LiOH, NaOH and KOH, which are indicative of the cation-dependent behavior of the Cur3-- fluorescence excitation and the emission spectra. The fluorescence quantum yield in the presence of LiOH and NaOH significantly increases compared to that of neutral curcumin. Studying the fluorescence polarization properties revealed that the observed increase in the quantum yield is accounted for by the decreased rate of the nonradiative excited-state deactivation. We assume that the origin of the cation-dependent fluorescence properties refers to the formation of coordination bonds between the alkali metal cations and the oxygen atoms of the β-diketone (keto-enol) group of curcumin, which is substantiated by the experimental results and supported by the semiempirical modeling.},

	abstract = {A new material formed by graphene oxide and a perylene diimide derivate was successfully synthesized and applied for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB). The perylene diimide was modified with APTES in a simple chemical method to force excimer formation. The new material showed to be capable of stabilizing the electron/ hole pair initiated by perylene diimides excimers formed after excitation in the visible range. Theoretical calculations show that the structures in which GO is perpendicular to the perylene core are more prompt to form the anion radical than pure GO, indicating that perpendicular excimers could play an important role in stabilizing electrons. This way, efficient removal of 90 % of methylene blue was observed since the mechanism of photodegradation of a dye depends on the efficient separation and mobility of carriers.},

	n2 = {Abstract Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen binding (H-NOX) domains bind gaseous ligands for signal transduction in organisms spanning prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms. In the bioluminescent marine bacterium Shewanella woodyi (Sw), H-NOX proteins regulate quorum sensing and biofilm formation. In higher animals, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) binds nitric oxide with an H-NOX domain to induce cyclase activity and regulate vascular tone, wound healing and memory formation. sGC also binds stimulator compounds targeting cardiovascular disease. The molecular details of stimulator binding to sGC remain obscure but involve a binding pocket near an interface between H-NOX and coiled-coil domains. Here, we report the full NMR structure for CO-ligated Sw H-NOX in the presence and absence of stimulator compound IWP-051, and its backbone dynamics. Nonplanar heme geometry was retained using a semi-empirical quantum potential energy approach. Although IWP-051 binding is weak, a single binding conformation was found at the interface of the two H-NOX subdomains, near but not overlapping with sites identified in sGC. Binding leads to rotation of the subdomains and closure of the binding pocket. Backbone dynamics are similar across both domains except for two helix-connecting loops, which display increased dynamics that are further enhanced by compound binding. Structure-based sequence analyses indicate high sequence diversity in the binding pocket, but the pocket itself appears conserved among H-NOX proteins. The largest dynamical loop lies at the interface between Sw H-NOX and its binding partner as well as in the interface with the coiled coil in sGC, suggesting a critical role for the loop in signal transduction.},

	abstract = {A study on the anxiolytic activity of the new derivatives of 11-dialkylaminoethyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodiazepino[1,2-a]benzimidazole, containing privileged scaffolds of benzodiazepine and benzimidazole in their structure, was conducted. The cytotoxic properties of low levels of six compounds were preliminary determined in vitro using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test. The screening of these substances for anxiolytic activity was conducted using elevated plus maze (EPM) test in vivo, and DAB-21 was found to be the most active compound. The acute toxicity of DAB-21 was determined as less toxic than that of diazepam. The dose-dependent effect of the most active compound revealed a minimum dose of 1.26 mg/kg, which resulted in the maximum counterphobic effect. The effect of DAB-21 was superior in a number of tests compared with that of diazepam, which indicated a high level of tranquilizing activity for DAB-21. The results of in silico docking analysis suggest that DAB-21 should have a slightly lower anxiolytic activity than diazepam, but should exhibit greater specific affinity for the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor, in comparison with its GABA-binding site. The interaction between DAB-21 and flumazenil in terms of EPM verifies the GABAergic mechanism of action of DAB-21. Our results highlight the potential of 11-dialkylaminomethyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodiazepino[1,2-a]benzimidazoles as promising compounds in the search for new highly effective anxiolytics.},

Upon examination of a substrate that has an alkyl group in place of the β-chlorine substituent, the spatial location of major catalyst-substrate interaction was determined. Subsequently, through computational analysis of transition states, the steric repulsion by the β-substituents as well as the additional C--H/π hydrogen bond by the alkyl substituent were proposed as the crucial stereo-determining factors.},

Therefore, the drug development process has been started in 2016. Since the pharmacokinetic characterization of a drug candidate is essential and albumin binding of drugs can strongly affect their pharmacokinetic properties, herein we provided the detailed investigation and characterization of the interaction of SZV 1287 and its known metabolites with serum albumin. In a preliminary animal study, we demonstrated the appearance of SZV 1287, oxaprozin, L 2799, L 2805, and L 2811 in the circulation after the per os administration of the parent compound to rats. Then albumin-ligand interactions were examined employing fluorescence spectroscopy, affinity chromatography, ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation, and molecular modeling. Finally, we tested the potential species dependent differences in the albumin binding of SZV 1287, employing human, bovine, porcine, and rat serum albumins. Our results demonstrated that SZV 1287 and its metabolites form highly stable complexes with albumin (Ka = 105 to 106 L/mol). Furthermore, SZV 1287 occupies Sudlow's Site II on human serum albumin. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that SZV 1287-albumin interaction is an important issue regarding the pharmacokinetics of this drug candidate.},

The optimal pH range (5.0--5.5) for preparing nano PECs was selected by experimental and computational methodologies, favoring the polymers interactions. CS, HA, HP and MTX addition order was also rationalized, maximizing their interactions and MTX entrapment. Spherical nano-sized particles (256--575 nm, by dynamic light scattering measurement) with positive surface charge (+25.5 to +29.2 mV) were successfully prepared.

Of note, the target is sometimes also referred to as macromolecule or biopolymer in the docking programs. In-house knowledge has been acquired over the last decade or so and is disclosed here to train users to practice docking on personal computers. This guide shows how to combine Autodock Vina with Autodock Tools, Swiss PDB Viewer, and Vega ZZ to prepare the input data and analyze the output data after docking. Special attention is drawn to include aspects, rarely laid open, about file management, input data preparation, and solving problems in a do-it-yourself manner. Pharmaceutical or medicinal chemistry knowledge is expected, while the practitioner is introduced step by step into the practical work of computational molecular docking simulations. The recommended way to use this chapter is to read through it first and then go into practical mode to carry out the docking simulation.},

	abstract = {In this study, the dynamic behavior, geometric structure, electron density parameters and infrared spectra for toluene(T)-water(W) systems were calculated using molecular dynamics simulation, quantum chemistry calculation and wavefunction analysis. Dynamic simulations demonstrate that there are three interaction ways, Hw{\ldots}πT, Hw{\ldots}CT and Ow{\ldots}CT, in TW system, and due to these interactions, each toluene can form 5~10H-bonds with water molecules, indicating that the toluene are easy to form H-bonds with H2O particularly at low temperature, while high temperature is harmful for that. Analyses of the TWn(n=1--10) cluster by quantum chemistry calculations and wavefunction analysis indicate that HW{\ldots}πT is primarily responsible for the stabilization of TWna(n=1--2), while OW{\ldots}HT is primarily responsible for the stabilization of TWna (n=3--10). In addition, Hw{\ldots}πT, Hw{\ldots}CT and Ow{\ldots}CT show the dispersion and electrostatic nature. Furthermore, the degeneracy and delocalization of free OH and donor O-H modes are changed due to the formation of Hw{\ldots}πT, Hw{\ldots}CT and Ow{\ldots}CT. The results displayed here have potential application prospects for the development of molecular recognition systems involving aromatic interactions.},

	abstract = {The hydrogen storage capacity of Boron Nitride nanosheet has been performed by using density functional theory (DFT). All the structural and electronic properties of a monolayer BN nanosheet are in well agreement with the previously reported results. Out of the four possible adsorption sites, centre is the most favourable adsorption site for H2 molecule with binding energy ∼0.212 eV/H2. We have proceeded our calculations considering this adsorption site. The calculated direct band gap within GGA and HSE for pristine h-BN monolayer are found to be 4.669 eV and 5.63 eV, respectively. In our calculation the Hydrogen storage capacity of BN nanosheet was found to be 6.7 wt.% well within benchmark value (6.0%) with an average adsorption energy of (∼0.128 eV/H2). Bader analysis revealed that the charge transfer from BN nanosheet to the H2 molecule is very low (0.004--0.065∣ e ∣) leading to weak binding of the H2 molecule. The calculated desorption temperature was found to be low due to low average adsorption energy of the H2 molecule. Also, upon increasing the number of H2 molecule adsorption a feeble tuning of the band gap has been observed due to the contribution of the 1s orbital of H2 molecule.},

	abstract = {The development of novel bioactive molecules without hERG ion channel blocking activities is one of the important tasks for the drug discovery scientists. Both experimental and in silico techniques are applied for screening/assaying of novel molecules and existing molecules against hERG ion channel to study its cardiotoxicity. Hence, in the present investigation, QSAR and multialgorithm based classification analysis such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayesian (BN) were performed on the data set possessed hERG ion channel blocking activity using different variable (MOE-descriptors and MACCS Fingerprints). The models developed with the MLR and the machine learning techniques provided significant results which were confirmed by their acceptable statistical parameter values. Further, the sum of ranking differences (SRDs) calculated for the models showed that the Model 6-MOE, Model 7-MOE, Model 4-SVM, Model 7-SVM and Model 9-SVM are having smaller SRD values and are placed as top ranked models. The MOE-descriptors and the MACCS Fingerprints contributed in these models revealed that the volume-surface area properties, negative charge on the vdW surface area, number of fluorine atom, number of aromatic ring/atoms, less number of oxygen and hydrogen bonding and donor atoms are contributed for the activity. Furthermore the MACCS Fingerprints such as MACCSFP42, MACCSFP85, MACCSFP122 and MACCSFP139 also explain the polarity of the compounds. The structural pattern analysis with the MACCS Fingerprint revealed that the aromatic rings responsible for hydrophobicity, halogen and heteroatoms provide polarity to the compounds and the asymmetric carbon make the compounds are highly flexible. These studies concluded that the derived results can be used for prediction of hERG ion channel blocking activity of novel molecules.},

	abstract = {Using the GUSAR 2013 program, the quantitative structure&ndash;antioxidant activity relationship has been studied for 74 phenols, aminophenols, aromatic amines and uracils having lgk7 = 0.01&ndash;6.65 (where k7 is the rate constant for the reaction of antioxidants with peroxyl radicals generated upon oxidation). Based on the atomic descriptors (Quantitative Neighborhood of Atoms (QNA) and Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atoms (MNA)) and molecular (topological length, topological volume and lipophilicity) descriptors, we have developed 9 statistically significant QSAR consensus models that demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the lgk7 values for the compounds of training sets and appropriately predict lgk7 for the test samples. Moderate predictive power of these models is demonstrated using metrics of two categories: (1) based on the determination coefficients R2 (R2TSi, R20, Q2(F1), Q2(F2), RmTSi2&macr;) and based on the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)); or (2) based on the prediction lgk7 errors (root mean square error (RMSEP), mean absolute error (MAE) and standard deviation (S.D.)) The RBF-SCR method has been used for selecting the descriptors. Our theoretical prognosis of the lgk7 for 8-PPDA, a known antioxidant, based on the consensus models well agrees with the experimental value measure in the present work. Thus, the algorithms for calculating the descriptors implemented in the GUSAR 2013 program allow simulating kinetic parameters of the reactions underling the liquid-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons.},

DFT computation showed that AEOL-10150 can form the most stable association complex {MnP{\ldots}OONO} among four AEOL models. AEOL-10150 complex with ONOO− has the lowest deformation energy. In AEOL compounds and their association complexes with ONOO−, Mn atom prefered the high spin state (S = 2) to the intermediate spin state (S = 1).

The vapor--liquid equilibrium (VLE) of H2O + IL systems was experimentally determined and predicted by the UNIFAC-Lei model. The results demonstrated that the vapor pressure is mainly dependent on the type of anion and increases slightly with an increase in the cation alkyl chain length. Quantum chemistry calculation and wavefunction analysis clearly revealed the relationship between the VLE and the HB interactions.

@article{Gunko:2021wm,
	abstract = {A set of characteristics calculated within the scope of quantum chemistry methods may be assigned to local ones changing from atom to atom in complex systems. Simple averaging of the related values gives rather poor characteristics of the systems because various fractions of certain atoms can have different surrounding and, therefore, different characteristics, which may not correspond to the average one. The aim of this study is searching a more appropriate pathway to transform local characteristics, e.g., atomic charges, into nonlocal ones based on the distribution functions. The distribution functions of atomic charges (CDF) could be considered as a simple tool to analyze nonuniform complex systems since specificity of different fractions of atoms reflects in the CDF shape. As a whole, the approach accuracy and efficiency depend on the quality and appropriateness of molecular and cluster models used, as well as on the quantum chemical methods (ab initio, DFT, and semiempirical) and the basis sets used. Nanosystems with dozens of molecules (clusters, domains, nanodroplets), modelling a liquid phase or interfacial layers, and solid nanoparticles of almost real sizes (> 40 units, > 2 nm) may be considered as more appropriate models of real systems than the models with several molecules and small clusters (< 20 units, < 1 nm). This approach has been applied to a set of representatives of such various materials as activated carbon, porous and nanoparticulate silicas unmodified and modified interacting with nitrogen, methane, water, human serum albumin (HSA) binding doxorubicin molecules.

	abstract = {The MolSSI Driver Interface (MDI) Project provides a standardized API for fast, on-the-fly communication between computational molecular sciences codes. This greatly simplifies the process of implementing methods that require the cooperation of multiple software packages and enables developers to write a single implementation that works across many different codes. The API is sufficiently general to support a wide variety of techniques, including QM/MM, ab initio MD, machine learning, advanced sampling, and path integral MD, while also being straightforwardly extensible. Communication between codes is handled by the MDI Library, which enables tight coupling between executables using either the MPI or TCP/IP methods.
Program summary
Program title: The MDI Library CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/8zppf699hm.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/MolSSI-MDI/MDI_Library Licensing provisions: BSD 3-clause Programming language: C, Python, and Fortran95 Nature of problem: Enabling direct communication of commands and data between independently compiled computational molecular sciences codes with minimal latency and in a manner consistent with the requirements of the MDI Project. Solution method: Inter-code communication via the MPI and TCP/IP communication protocols is implemented within the context of a library, with all choices regarding the communication protocol being made by the end-user at runtime. Messages are validated based on expected data type and length, and self-consistent unit conversions are provided. The library builds via CMake, with support for the Unix, Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems and for codes using the C, C++, Python, and Fortran languages. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The MDI Library does not itself perform any scientific calculations, but instead facilitates communication between other codes. The MDI Library is a component of the larger MDI Project, which is described in more detail throughout this paper.},

	abstract = {The biosynthesis of R-phenylacetylcarbinol (R-PAC) by the acetohydroxy acid synthase, (AHAS) is addressed by molecular dynamics simulations (MD), hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), and QM/MM free energy calculations. The results show the reaction starts with the nucleophilic attack of the C2α atom of the HEThDP intermediate on the Cβ atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde substrate via the formation of a transition state (TS1) with the HEThDP intermediate under 4′-aminopyrimidium (APH+) form. The calculated activation free energy for this step is 17.4kcal mol−1 at 27 $\,^{\circ}$C. From this point, the reaction continues with the abstraction of Hβ atom of the HEThDP intermediate by the Oβ atom of benzaldehyde to form the intermediate I. The reaction is completed with the cleavage of the bond C2α-C2 to form the product R-PAC and to regenerate the ylide intermediate under the APH+ form, allowing in this way to reinitiate to the catalytic cycle once more. The calculated activation barrier for this last step is 15.9kcal mol−1 at 27 $\,^{\circ}$C.},

	abstract = {Nitroaromatic explosives are major pollutants produced during wars that cause serious environmental and health problems. The removal of a typical nitroaromatic explosive, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), from aqueous solution, was conducted using a new recyclable magnetic nano-adsorbent (Fe@SiO2NH2). This adsorbent was prepared by grafting amino groups onto Fe@SiO2 particles with a well-defined core-shell structure and demonstrated monodispersity in solution. The removal performance of the nano-adsorbent towards TNT was found to be 2.57 and 4.92 times higher than that towards two analogous explosives, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT), respectively, under neutral conditions. The difference in the removal performance among the three compounds was further compared in terms of the effects of different conditions (pH value, ionic strength, humic acid concentration, adsorbent modification degree and dosage, etc.) and the electrostatic potential distributions of the three compounds. The most significant elevation is owing to modification of amino on Fe@SiO2 which made a 20.7% increase in adsorption efficiency of TNT. The experimental data were well fit by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model, indicating multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface. The experimental results and theoretical considerations show that the interactions between Fe@SiO2NH2 NPs and TNT correspond to dipole-dipole and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions should be considered in the design of an adsorbent. Furthermore, the adaptability to aqueous environment and excellent regeneration capacity of Fe@SiO2NH2 NPs makes these remediation materials promising for applications.},

The calculations of physical properties and quantum chemical parameters correlated to the inhibition efficiency and discussed at the equilibrium geometry. The results indicated that the 1-Isoquinolinyl Phenyl Ketone could be adsorbed on the mild steel surface firmly through the nitrogen atom on the isoquinoline rings and the carbonyl group. Besides, the moderate values of parameters describe the low-efficiency of inhibition in acidic and saline medium.

	abstract = {We present a holistic crystallographic study of the antiviral ganciclovir, including insights into its solid-state behavior, which could prove useful during drug development, making the process more sustainable. A newly developed methodology was used incorporating a combination of statistical and thermodynamic approaches, which can be applied to various crystalline materials. We demonstrate how the chemical environment and orientation of a functional group can affect its accessibility for participation in hydrogen bonding. The difference in the nature and strength of intermolecular contacts between the two anhydrous forms, exposed through full interaction maps and Hirshfeld surfaces, leads to the manifestation of conformational polymorphism. Variations in the intramolecular geometry and intermolecular interactions of both forms of ganciclovir were identified as possible predictors for their relative thermodynamic stability. It was shown through energy frameworks how the extensive supramolecular network of contacts in form I causes a higher level of compactness and lower enthalpy relative to form II. The likelihood of the material to exhibit polymorphism was assessed through a hydrogen bond propensity model, which predicted a high probability associated with the formation of other relatively stable forms. However, this model failed to classify the stability of form I appropriately, suggesting that it might not have fully captured the collective impacts which govern polymorphic stability.},

	abstract = {Bifunctionalized carbon nanocones are proposed as removers of insecticide acetamiprid through in silico studies. Four models were studied including functionalization in surface and the edge with --COOH and --OH groups. In all models, the minimum energy structure obtained of density functional theory simulations is where the acetamiprid is positioned over the concave side of the nanocones, besides, they present high adsorption energy from −68.24 kcal/mol up to −82.19 kcal/mol. From the analysis of the non-covalent interactions (NCI index), we show that the main contacts present in the adducts are through weak attractive interactions. Besides, given the anionic nature of the nanocones, the presence of a strong interaction between lone pair electrons of these and the π orbitals of the acetamiprid is expected. Likewise, from the electronic properties, the systems present low values for ionization potential, chemical potential, and work function. Furthermore, their dipole moment increase when the models are simulated in aqueous solution. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations show that even using a classical model it is possible adequately describe the adsorption energy. However, electronic effects are necessary to discern between different models. These functionalized nanocones could be used as adsorbents of neonicotinoid insecticides.},

	abstract = {Conformational energies are an important chemical property for which a performance assessment of theoretical methods is mandatory. Existing benchmark sets are often limited to biochemical or main group element containing molecules{,} while organometallic systems are generally less studied. A key problem herein is to routinely generate conformers for these molecules due to their complexity and manifold of possible coordination patterns. In this study we used our recently published CREST protocol [Pracht et al.{,} Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.{,} 2020{,} 22{,} 7169--7192] to generate conformer ensembles for a variety of 40 challenging transition metal containing molecules{,} which were then used to form a comprehensive conformational energy benchmark set termed TMCONF40. Several low-cost semiempirical{,} density functional theory (DFT) and force-field methods were compared to high level DLPNO-CCSD(T1) and double-hybrid DFT reference values. Close attention was paid to the energetic ordering of the conformers in the statistical evaluation. With respect to the double-hybrid references{,} both tested low-cost composite DFT methods produce high Pearson correlation coefficients of rp{,}mean{,}B97-3c//B97-3c = 0.922 and rp{,}mean{,}PBEh-3c//B97-3c = 0.890{,} with mean absolute deviations close to or below 1 kcal mol−1. This good performance also holds for a comparison to DLPNO-CCSD(T1) reference energies for a smaller subset termed TMCONF5. Based on DFT geometries{,} the GFNn-xTB methods yield reasonable Pearson correlation coefficients of rp{,}mean{,}GFN1-xTB//B97-3c = 0.617 (MADmean = 2.15 kcal mol−1) and rp{,}mean{,}GFN2-xTB//B97-3c = 0.567 (MADmean = 2.68 kcal mol−1){,} outperforming the widely used PMx methods on the TMCONF40 test set. Employing the low-cost composite DFT method B97-3c on GFN2-xTB geometries yields an slightly improved correlation of rp{,}mean{,}B97-3c//GFN2-xTB = 0.632. Furthermore{,} for 68% of the investigated complexes at least one low-energy conformer was found that is more stable than the respective crystal structure conformation{,} which signals the importance of conformational studies. General recommendations for the application of the CREST protocol and DFT methods for transition metal conformational energies are given.},

	abstract = {Lipophosphoramidates are a class of amphiphilic molecules that are tunable; and are heavily explored for a variety of industrial and medicinal applications. Self-assembled structures derived from such molecules enhance the bioavailability, selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties of drug molecules. Herein we report the synthesis of novel glyco-lipophosphoramidates (GLP-3, GLP-4, GLP-5, GLP-6) with varying linear and branched hydrocarbon tails via the Staudinger-phosphite reaction. The incorporation of the carbohydrate moiety as the head group region of the amphiphile promotes biocompatibility and biodegradability. Surface activity, adsorption, and aggregation behavior in aqueous solution were examined using surface tension, Langmuir monolayers, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The critical aggregation concentrations (CAC) and Langmuir isotherms showed the typical dependence on acyl chain structure. Gibbs adsorption profiles provided limiting molecular areas in the range 55--85 {\AA}2. AFM imaging revealed the formation of large spherical aggregates in aqueous solution above the CAC. Dye encapsulation studies support the self-assembly into vesicles by GLP-3, GLP-4 and GLP-5; demonstrating the potential for drug delivery or nanocarrier applications.},

The general applicability of autodE is demonstrated in complex multi-step reactions, including cobalt- and rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation and an Ireland--Claisen rearrangement.},

	abstract = {We present here design, preparation, characterization, and properties of a photochromic supramolecular complex of benzopyran containing benzo-18-crown-6-ether 1 with 4-aminonaphthalimide 2 as a fluorophore. Phototransformation of the supramolecular complex 1⋅2 is accompanied by the appearance of a predominantly open TC form, which is consistent with the monoexponential bleaching curve of an open form at room temperature. Compared with free benzopyran 1, the bleaching rate is increased by 5--6 times in the presence of 2. From a synthetic point of view, varying the components in the supramolecular complex is more preferable to obtain a system with the desired characteristics. Thus, this study demonstrates that the supramolecular approach is promising for systems that contain photochromic and fluorescent components that influence each other.},

	abstract = {Molecular interactions between o-aminobenzoate (oAB) and isoallxazine (Iso) in o-aminobenzoate - d-amino acid oxidase complex (ODC) were studied by means of molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and molecular orbital (MO) method. The distances between oAB and Iso were 0.60 in subunit A (Sub A) and 0.58 nm in Sub B. Four of six heteroatoms of Iso ring formed hydrogen bonding (HB) with nearby amino acids. The oxygen atom and nitrogen atom of oAB also formed HB with amino acids. The ODC displays a broad absorption band around 570 nm, which is considered to be charge transfer (CT) band between oAB and Iso in the complex. The ODC displayed fluorescence at around 520 nm, which is different from that of DAAO (emission peak at 535 nm) without oAB. The emission is from a local excited state (LE) without CT interaction. The CT interaction was studied by a semi-empirical molecular orbital (MO) method, using the structures of oAB and Iso obtained by MDS. The CT state did not form in the ground state of Iso, but formed in the excited state of Iso (Iso*), when the both cannot move appreciably from the MDS structures. The CT states formed both in the oAB -- Iso and oAB -- Iso* (excited state of Iso) systems when the both molecules can move so as to attain the minimum energy state. It is concluded that a part of oAB could move to form CT complex with Iso in the ground state, which displays the CT absorption band, but others could not move in the protein without CT interaction, which displays the fluorescence.},

Intermolecular interactions in the salt investigated through Hirshfeld surfaces and 2D finger plots, showed that the C..H, N..H, O..H and H{\ldots}H interactions were 15.4%, 2.2%,37.6% and 41.3% respectively. The water molecules occupy around 19.2% of the total volume of the unit cell and also contribute significantly to the stability of the crystal. As the salt crystallizes in a non-centerosymmetric space group, it can exhibit second order non-linear optical properties. MOPAC was used to calculate the hyperpolarizability, it was found to be 3.29378 10−30 esu. A database analysis to compare the bond parameters and the physical properties like hyperpolarizability etc. in 4-aminopyridine and its complexes was undertaken.

The crystal has the ability to transmit wider range of EM radiation. The optical band gap evaluated by plotting Tauc's graph is 3.08 eV. Third order nonlinear response of the material is studied by the open aperture z scan experiment. The second harmonic generation efficiency obtained by Kurtz experiment is 7.4 times that of urea. The material's NLO response is analyzed with the help of the literature, and it can be concluded that the optimal arrangements of planar molecules in the crystal structure combined by the hydrogen bond interactions result in an increase in SHG efficiency. Further, the role of pyridine ring at the benzoyl arm on the NLO property of methoxy substituted chalcones is also discussed. Due to the wider transparency window and large SH conversion capability, DMPP can be used for various opto electronic applications.},

	abstract = {To design a reasonable structure of cathode with high electrical conductivity is important for the development of the lithium-sulfur batteries. Less electronic conductivity of cathode will lead to the poor rate capability. In this paper, we constructed the Li2S-P2S5 system as the composite cathode model of the lithium-sulfur battery and used first-principles calculations to study P2S5-adsorbed Li2S(110) surface, including surface's structural stability, absorption type, and electronic properties. It is found that P2S5 is strongly adsorbed on the Li2S(110) surface with the adsorption energy -7.16 eV per molecule. Our calculations reveal the micro mechanism why the Li2S-P2S5 is a high-performance composite cathode material: appearance of new electronic states and the formation of two PS43− from per P2S5 molecule.},

In this study, 1,3-benzothiazol-2-ylacetonitrile azo dyes (1--6) have been resynthesized, one and two dimensional 1H and 13C NMR, as well as absorption and emission spectra, were collected and interpreted. The obtained results were used to clarify the tautomerization phenomenon of these dyes. Predominantly, these dyes exist in Z-hydrazone form reinforced through intramolecular hydrogen bonding in deuterated chloroform. Substituents (R) in carbon7 (CR7) are the key player of the changes in 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts, also in the absorption and emission wavelengths of benzothiazole azo dyes. Also, the relative photoluminescence quantum yields (PL QY) of these dyes (1--6) were estimated and related to the nature of substituents. Finally, PM6 semiempirical calculations were employed to confirm the preferred geometric structure and experimental NMR, absorption, and emission results.},

	abstract = {Triboelectric charging is defined as the phenomenon of charge transfer between two different material surfaces when they are brought into contact and separated. The focus of this research is the development of a Discrete Element Method (DEM) based simulation model to predict tribocharging during hopper discharge. Due to decreased particle-wall interactions and reduced particle wall contact times, net charges generated during hopper discharge are low. The simulation model confirmed this effect and was implemented to predict the triboelectric behavior of glass beads and MCC particles during hopper flow, along with the prediction of percent charged and uncharged particles. Approximately one-third of the particles were predicted to remain uncharged during the hopper discharge simulations for mono-dispersed particles, thus rendering a comparatively high amount of charge distribution into a small concentration of materials. The DEM model acted as a tool to predict charges that can be generated during hopper discharge at a specified geometry, with a potential to mitigate particle charging, when used for appropriate selection of hopper angles, and hopper wall materials.},

	abstract = {Two new composites containing perylene diimides derivates covalently bonded to graphene oxide were obtained and their antimicrobial properties were applied against Escherichia coli, a model of gram-negative bacteria. The perylene diimides were prepared by condensating perylene dianhydride with ethyldiamine (PEDI2) or decyldiamine (PEDI10) and then, a SOCl2 modified GO sample reacted with perylene diimides, originating the respective covalently bonded GO/PEDI2 and GO/PEDI10. Semi-empirical calculations with PM6-DH2X (MOPAC 2016) confirmed the photophysical results and showed that perylene diimides could form three different structures when bonded to GO: (1) parallel to GO, forming π-stacking interaction; (2) parallel to GO, but not superimposed π-systems (pns-π), and; (3) perpendicular to the GO molecular plane (T-shape). The photophysical studies showed that both GO/PEDI2 and GO/PEDI10 composites were able to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) when perylene diimides did not form π-stacking with GO. Finally, the photochemical reactivities of such covalently bonded composites were confirmed by the increased bacterial inhibition when E. coli (more than 80 %) is irradiated in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum when compared to dark conditions GO.},

But very low solubility and dissolution rate of ACF compromise its therapeutic utility. Now a day&#8217;s cocrystallization technique has emerged as a novel technique for modulation of the said problems. <br></br> Objective: The Specific objectives of this research work were mechanochemical synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation of aceclofenac cocrystal. <br></br> Methods: ACF was screened with various pharmaceutically acceptable coformers (Selected from GRAS and EAFUS list) using MOPAC software and physical screening method to find out novel cocrystals of ACF with enhanced solubility and dissolution rate. Novel cocrystals (multi-component crystalline solid) of ACF with l-cystine were prepared by a neat grinding method and by liquid assisted grinding method. The synthesized cocrystals (ACF-l-CYS NG and ACF-l-CYS LAG) were characterized carefully by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), and Powder XRay Diffraction (PXRD) to verify the formation of the cocrystals. Pharmaceutically significant properties such as powder dissolution rate, solubility, and stability of the prepared cocrystals were evaluated. <br></br> Results: Compared to pure ACF, the prepared cocrystals showed superior solubility and dissolution rate. The prepared cocrystals were found to be stable and non-hygroscopic under study conditions. <br></br> Conclusion: The cocrystallization technique was successfully utilized to increase the solubility and dissolution rate of aceclofenac.},

The AHMT-doped hybrid sol--gel coatings were characterized through different methods. Interactions between the hybrid AHMT-doped sol--gel and copper metal were demonstrated by quantum chemical calculations based on the density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. The results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization analysis of the hybrid AHMT-doped sol--gel coating at pH 4 demonstrated enhanced corrosion resistance compared to the data from the tests at pH values of 7 and 11. This can be explained by the formation of an effectively packed layer, which acted as a physical barrier against corrosive chloride ions that protected copper metal against corrosion.},

	abstract = {We present RegioSQM20, a new version of RegioSQM (Chem Sci 9:660, 2018), which predicts the regioselectivities of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions from the calculation of proton affinities. The following improvements have been made: The open source semiempirical tight binding program xtb is used instead of the closed source MOPAC program. Any low energy tautomeric forms of the input molecule are identified and regioselectivity predictions are made for each form. Finally, RegioSQM20 offers a qualitative prediction of the reactivity of each tautomer (low, medium, or high) based on the reaction center with the highest proton affinity. The inclusion of tautomers increases the success rate from 90.7 to 92.7{\%}. RegioSQM20 is compared to two machine learning based models: one developed by Struble et al. (React Chem Eng 5:896, 2020) specifically for regioselectivity predictions of EAS reactions (WLN) and a more generally applicable reactivity predictor (IBM RXN) developed by Schwaller et al. (ACS Cent Sci 5:1572, 2019). RegioSQM20 and WLN offers roughly the same success rates for the entire data sets (without considering tautomers), while WLN is many orders of magnitude faster. The accuracy of the more general IBM RXN approach is somewhat lower: 76.3--85.0{\%}, depending on the data set. The code is freely available under the MIT open source license and will be made available as a webservice (regiosqm.org) in the near future.},

In order to deepen our understanding of IL − alkylation in general, the electronic properties of [BMIm][AlCl4]/benzene/reactant system were analyzed by the ADCH charge analysis, DOS analysis, frontier molecular orbital analysis, non − covalent interactions (NCI), and energy decomposition analysis (EDA). ADCH analysis reveals that benzene could markedly affect the charge transfer of alkanes and chloroaluminate anions, which weakened the super−acidity of the IL. Frontier molecular orbital analysis shows that the IL system has a significant decrease of H − Lgap, and it increases the sensitivity of the reactants. The anchoring effect of [BMIm]+ cation was observed in the DOS spectra, which enhanced stabilization of the IL structure. NCI analysis shows that π − H bonds could be formed between benzene and the IL. It is believed that better alkylation performance of IL/benzene system is due to these weak interactions.},

In particular, the neurotoxic action of BASs needs to be studied as diverse epidemiological studies have reported associations between exposure to BASs and neural diseases. In this study, we developed in silico models to predict the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation of organic and inorganic BASs. Due to a lack of BBB data for BASs, the chemical space of BASs and BBB dataset were compared in order to select BBB data that were structurally similar to BASs. In silico models to predict log-scaled BBB penetration were developed using support vector regression for organic BASs and multiple linear regression for inorganic BASs. The model for organic BASs was developed with 231 compounds (training set: 153 and test set: 78) and achieved good prediction accuracy on an external test set (R2 = 0.64), and the model outperformed the model for pharmaceuticals. The model for inorganic BASs was developed with 11 compounds (R2 = 0.51). Applicability domain (AD) analysis of the models clarified molecular structures reliably predicted by the models. Therefore, the models developed in this study can be used for predicting BBB permeable BASs in human. These models were developed according to the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship validation principles proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.},

The MOPAC2016 software package has long been at the forefront of semiempirical quantum chemical methods (SEQMs) for small molecules, proteins, and solids and until this release has included only NDDO-type SEQMs. The new code enables the calculation of excited states using the INDO/S Hamiltonian combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach using single excitations (CIS), single and double excitations (CISD), or multiple reference determinants (MRCI) where reference determinants are generated using a complete active space (CAS) approach. The capacity to perform excited-state calculations beyond the CIS level makes INDO/CI one of the few low-cost computational methods capable of accurately modeling states with substantial double-excitation character. Solvent corrections to the ground-state and excited-state energies can be computed using the COSMO implicit solvent model, incorporating state-specific corrections to the excited states based on the solvent refractive index. This code produces physically reasonable electronic structures, absorption spectra, and solvatochromic shifts at low computational costs for systems up to hundreds of atoms, and for both organic molecules and metal clusters.},
