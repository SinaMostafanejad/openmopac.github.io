API Documentation
=================

For now, this page will explain how to use MOPAC's existing disk-based API.

This page will also contain API information for the diskless input and output for MOPAC as it is developed.

We should also solicit user input on what features to prioritize in this API.

Other available interfaces to MOPAC should also be listed, such as popular GUI's and MDI.
