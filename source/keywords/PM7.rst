PM7
===

Use the default semiempirical model, PM7 :cite:p:`Stewart:2013`.
See the :ref:`model_overview` for a comparison of the various models available in MOPAC.

.. note:
   Because PM7 is the default model, this keyword is presently unnecessary.
   However, it will enable forward compatibility of input files with future versions of MOPAC that have a different default model.
