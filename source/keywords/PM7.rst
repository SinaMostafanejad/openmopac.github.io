``PM7``
=======

The PM7 method is to be used. This keyword is redundant because the
default method in MOPAC2016 is PM7. See also `Accuracy of PM7 and
PM6-D3H4 <../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/Accuracy%20of%20PM7%20and%20PM6-D3H4.html>`__

Notes on PM7
------------

PM7 uses a "D2" type correction for the elements:  H, He, B, C, N, O, F,
Ne, P, S, Cl, Ar, Br, and Kr.  For the other elements, a core-core
Gaussian attractive terms is used to mimic dispersion.  This means that
some form of dispersion is present for all elements.  The core-core
Gaussian terms are optimized to reproduce reference geometries and heats
of formation.
