.. _SINGLET:

SINGLET
=======

Targets a singlet spin state in all calculations, which is a synonym for ``MS=0``.
See the :ref:`MS` keyword for more information.

Singlet states are already the default for Hartree-Fock calculations,
but this keyword can force the target of configuration interaction calculations
to be a singlet state rather than the lowest-energy integer-spin state.
