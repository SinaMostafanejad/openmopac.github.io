The Ramachandra angles φ, ψ, and ω for residues in a protein are
printed.  In the output the names of these angles are "Phi", "Psi", and
"Omega"

An estimate of the accuracy of prediction of the peptide twist angle ω
can be obtained by comparing the calculated PM7 twist angles with those
found in PDB structures.  A set of 2833 peptide bonds found in ten
proteins deposited in the PDB in March 2021 was used in making this
comparison.  The histogram of the difference between the calculated and
observed torsion angles is shown in the chart. To see the raw data,
download `Ramachandran <Ramachandran%20angles.zip>`__. As expected, the
calculated torsion angles are more often less than that observed, as can
be seen at -10 and 10 degrees difference.
