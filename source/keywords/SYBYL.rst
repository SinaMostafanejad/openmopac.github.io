.. _SYBYL:

``SYBYL``
=========

Output for use by Tripos's SYBYL program can be generated by use of
SYBYL.  This requires a minimum of at least one SCF calculation to be
done, in order to calculate the heat of formation, partial charges, HOMO
and LUMO energies.  A normal output is also required, so SYBYL should
*not* be used with keywords that prevent normal output, i.e., it should
not be used with ``FORCE``, ``STEP``, ``DRC``, etc.
