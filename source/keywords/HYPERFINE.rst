.. _HYPERFINE:

``HYPERFINE``
=============

The quantity:

(1/3)(*P\ s\ α - P\ s\ β +2*\ (ψ:sub:`s`\ :sup:`α`)\ :sup:`2`)

is printed for all atoms in a radical when ``HYPERFINE`` is specified
for a UHF system. The ψ\ :sub:`s`\ :sup:`α` refers to the highest
occupied alpha-spin molecular orbital. This quantity is of use in
predicting hyperfine coupling coefficients.
