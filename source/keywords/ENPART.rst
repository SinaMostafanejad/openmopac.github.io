``ENPART``
==========

This is a very useful tool for analyzing the energy terms within a
system. The total energy, in eV, obtained by the addition of the
electronic and nuclear terms, is partitioned into mono- and bi-centric
contributions (if ```LARGE`` <large.html>`__ is present), and these
contributions in turn are divided into nuclear and one- and two-electron
terms (if ```LARGE`` <large.html>`__ is present). 

Atoms can be grouped into sets, up to 9 sets are allowed.  The format is
ENPART(n1, n2,n3...) where n1, n2, n3, etc., are the number of atoms in
each set.  All atoms in each set must be together in the geometry file. 
For example, to do an energy partition on the water molecule, use atoms
O, H, H, O, H, H, and use ENPART(3,3).  In this, the first three atoms
are the first water molecule.

Here is an example of energy partitioning for the HF dimer.  In order to
work out the HF - HF interaction energy, keyword ENPART(2,2) was used.

   The two-center energies of each atom pair is in the column EE.
   Unless you're REALLY interested in it, the component parts are not useful.  

   Energy of the first HF = one-center energy of F 1 (-467.145) + 
   one-center energy of H 2 (-6.229) + two-center energy of H 2 - F 1 interaction (-11.866)  
   Energy of the second HF = one-center energy of F 3 (-467.145) + 
   one-center energy of H 4 (-6.229) + two-center energy of H 4 - F 3 interaction (-11.866)  
   Energy of interaction of the first HF with the second HF = two-center energies of F 3 - F 1 - H interaction (0.321) 
   +  F 3 - H 2 (-0.350) + H 4 - F 1 (-0.350) + H 4 - H 2 (0.341) = -0.039eV 
   TOTAL OF ONE-CENTER TERMS = ELECTRON-NUCLEAR  (ONE-ELECTRON) + ELECTRON-ELECTRON (TWO-ELECTRON) 
   TOTAL ELECTROSTATIC INTERACTION =  ELECTRON-ELECTRON REPULSION + ELECTRON-NUCLEAR ATTRACTION + 
   NUCLEAR-NUCLEAR REPULSION 
   GRAND TOTAL OF TWO-CENTER TERMS =  (EXCHANGE + RESONANCE ENERGY) + TOTAL ELECTROSTATIC INTERACTION 
   ETOT (EONE + ETWO) = TOTAL OF ONE-CENTER TERMS + GRAND TOTAL OF TWO-CENTER TERMS
    = TOTAL ENERGY just after FINAL HEAT OF FORMATION in output
