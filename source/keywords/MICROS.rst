.. _MICROS:

``MICROS``
==========

The microstates used by MECI are normally generated by use of a
permutation operator. When individually defined microstates are desired,
then ``MICROS=n`` can be used, where *n* defines the number of
microstates to be read in.

Format for Microstates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the geometry data and any symmetry data are read in, data defining
each microstate is read in, using format 20I1, at one microstate per
line. The microstate data is preceded by the word "MICROS" on a line by
itself. Examples of microstates for two electrons in two M.O.s are given
in the Table.

| For a system with *n* M.O.s in the C.I. (use ``OPEN=(m,n)`` or
  ``C.I.=n`` to do this), the populations of the *n* alpha M.O.s are
  defined, followed by the *n* beta M.O.s. Allowed occupancies are zero
  and one. For *n*\ =6 the closed-shell ground state would be defined as
  111000111000, meaning one electron in each of the first three alpha
  M.O.s, and one electron in each of the first three beta M.O.s.

Users are warned that they are responsible for completing any spin
manifolds. Thus, while the state 111100110000 is a triplet state with
component of spin = 1, the state 111000110100, while having a component
of spin M\ :sub:`S` = 0, is neither a singlet nor a triplet. In order to
complete the spin manifold the microstate 110100111000 must also be
included.

  If a manifold of spin states is not complete, then the eigenstates of
the spin operator will not be quantized.

There are two other limitations on possible microstates. First, the
number of electrons in every microstate should be the same. If they
differ, a warning message will be printed, and the calculation
continued, but the results will almost certainly be nonsense. Second,
the component of spin for every microstate must be the same, except for
teaching purposes. Two microstates of different components of spin will
have a zero matrix element connecting them. No warning will be given as
this is a reasonable operation in a teaching situation. For example, if
all states arising from two electrons in two levels are to be
calculated, say for teaching Russell-Saunders coupling, then the
microstates given in the Table would be used.

Constraints on the space manifold are just as rigorous, but much  
easier to satisfy. If the energy levels are degenerate, then all
components of a manifold of degenerate M.O.s should be either included
or excluded. If only some, but not all, components are used, the
required degeneracy of the states will be missing.

As an example, for the tetrahedral methane cation, if the user  
supplies the microstates corresponding to a component of spin
M\ :sub:`S` = 3/2,   neglecting Jahn-Teller distortion, the minimum
number of states that can be supplied is 90 = (6!/(1!5!))(6!/(4!2!)).
This corresponds to the configuration
|$(t_2)^3(overline{t_2})^1(t_2^*)^1(overline{t_2^*})^0$|.

The format is defined as 20I1 so that spaces can be used for empty
M.O.s.
