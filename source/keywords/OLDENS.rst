.. _OLDENS:

``OLDENS``
==========

A density matrix produced by an earlier run of MOPAC is to be used to
start the current calculation. This can be used in attempts to obtain an
SCF when a previous calculation ended successfully but a subsequent run
failed to achieve an SCF.

The density matrix contains information on the electron density
distribution only.Â  It does not contain any information on the geometry.

The opposite of ``OLDENS`` is ```DENOUT`` <denout.html>`__

See also ```RESTART`` <restart.html>`__.
