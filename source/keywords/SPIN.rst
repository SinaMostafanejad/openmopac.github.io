.. _SPIN:

``SPIN``
========

The spin matrix, defined as the difference between the alpha and beta
density matrices, is to be printed. If the system has a closed-shell
ground state, e.g. methane run UHF, the spin matrix will be null.

If ``SPIN`` is not requested in a UHF calculation, then the diagonal of
the spin matrix, that is the spin density on the atomic orbitals, will
be printed.
