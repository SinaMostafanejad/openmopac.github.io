.. _NOCOMMENTS:

``NOCOMMENTS``
==============

 

When PDB files are read in, all data before the geometry is ignored when
``NOCOMMENTS`` (abbreviation: ``NOCOM``) is present.  If ``NOCOMMENTS``
is not present, the data before the geometry will be read in and output
in any PDB files written and in the ARC file, as comments. Keyword
``NOCOMMENTS`` is not output in the ARC files.
