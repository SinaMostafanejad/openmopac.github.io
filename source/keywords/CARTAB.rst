.. _CARTAB:

``CARTAB``
==========

Print part of the character table for the appropriate point group.  Only
the operations essential for defining the character table are printed,
thus, for example, the complete character table for Td is

.. raw:: html

   <div align="center">

Point Group Td

.. raw:: html

   </div>

The character table printed is  abbreviated:

   <div align="center">

.. raw:: html

   </div>

All missing operations can readily be generated by multiplying two or
more operations together, thus in Td, the S\ :sub:`4` operation can be
generated by multiplying a Σ\ :sub:`d` by C\ :sub:`2`.
