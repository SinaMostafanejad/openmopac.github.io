``C.A.S.``
==========

``C.A.S=n, C.A.S.=(n,m)`` 

Available for ```INDO`` <indo.html>`__-based CI calculations only. A
complete active space calculation will be performed within an active
space of *n* M.O.s. If only *n* is specified, the *n* M.O.s which
‘bracket’ the occupied-virtual energy levels are selected. (see
``C.I.=n``\ ` <C.I.=n.html>`__ for details). In ``C.A.S.=(n,m)``, *n* is
the number of M.O.s in the active space, and *m* is the number of doubly
filled (that is, not empty or partially filled) levels to be used. If an
MRCI calculation is requested without specifying C.A.S., the default
active space for the C.A.S. reference determinants is (2,1).

If the C.A.S. keyword is combined with another CI-related keyword
(```MRCI, CIS,  CISD, C.I., or C.I.D.`` <MRCI.html>`__), the excitations
generated by C.A.S. will be used as reference determinants to generate
single excitations (or single and double excitations, for ``CISD`` and
``C.I.D.``).

Note that the number of excitations in C.A.S. scales exponentially with
size of the active space; only a small handful of molecular orbitals can
be included in the C.A.S. active space before the computational cost
becomes prohibitive. This is particularly true if the C.A.S.
determinants are used as reference determinants for MRCI.
