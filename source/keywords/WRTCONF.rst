.. _WRTCONF:

``WRTCONF=n.nn`` 
=================

Available for ```INDO`` <indo.html>`__-based CI calculations only. For
each excited state, print the CI coefficients of all electron
configurations with coefficients greater than *n.nn*. The default value
is 0.04. Smaller values give a more precise view of the composition of
the CI states, but can make the output files large.
