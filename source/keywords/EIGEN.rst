.. _EIGEN:

``EIGEN``
---------

```MOZYME`` <mozyme.html>`__ works with localized molecular orbitals. To
allow the canonical molecular orbitals, or eigenvectors, to be
displayed, ``EIGEN`` should be used. It does not cause anything to be
output, but it does modify the output generated by other keywords.

Keywords affected by ``EIGEN`` are:

-  `VECTORS <vectors.html>`__: on its own, ``VECTORS`` will print out
   the localized molecular orbitals; if ``EIGEN`` is also present, then
   ``VECTORS`` will print out the eigenvectors (and eigenvalues).
