	n2 = {Abstract Twenty years ago, the landmark AM1 was introduced, and has since had an increasingly wide following among chemists due to its consistently good results and time-tested reliability?being presently available in countless computational quantum chemistry programs. However, semiempirical molecular orbital models still are of limited accuracy and need to be improved if the full potential of new linear scaling techniques, such as MOZYME and LocalSCF, is to be realized. Accordingly, in this article we present RM1 (Recife Model 1): a reparameterization of AM1. As before, the properties used in the parameterization procedure were: heats of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials and geometric variables (bond lengths and angles). Considering that the vast majority of molecules of importance to life can be assembled by using only six elements: C, H, N, O, P, and S, and that by adding the halogens we can now build most molecules of importance to pharmaceutical research, our training set consisted of 1736 molecules, representative of organic and biochemistry, containing C, H, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I atoms. Unlike AM1, and similar to PM3, all RM1 parameters have been optimized. For enthalpies of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials, and interatomic distances, the average errors in RM1, for the 1736 molecules, are less than those for AM1, PM3, and PM5. Indeed, the average errors in kcal Â·mol?1 of the enthalpies of formation for AM1, PM3, and PM5 are 11.15, 7.98, and 6.03, whereas for RM1 this value is 5.77. The errors, in Debye, of the dipole moments for AM1, PM3, PM5, and RM1 are, respectively, 0.37, 0.38, 0.50, and 0.34. Likewise, the respective errors for the ionization potentials, in eV, are 0.60, 0.55, 0.48, and 0.45, and the respective errors, in angstroms, for the interatomic distances are 0.036, 0.029, 0.037, and 0.027. The RM1 average error in bond angles of 6.82$\,^{\circ}$is only slightly higher than the AM1 figure of 5.88$\,^{\circ}$, and both are much smaller than the PM3 and PM5 figures of 6.98$\,^{\circ}$and 9.83$\,^{\circ}$, respectively. Moreover, a known error in PM3 nitrogen charges is corrected in RM1. Therefore, RM1 represents an improvement over AM1 and its similar successor PM3, and is probably very competitive with PM5, which is a somewhat different model, and not fully disclosed. RM1 possesses the same analytical construct and the same number of parameters for each atom as AM1, and, therefore, can be easily implemented in any software that already has AM1, not requiring any change in any line of code, with the sole exception of the values of the parameters themselves. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {We analyse the failure of the semiempirical QM method PM6 to describe halogen bonds and suggest an empirical correction that remedies this problem. Owing to underestimated repulsion in the PM6 method, the halogen-bond interaction energies are dramatically exaggerated and the equilibrium distances are very short. This is addressed by a correction parametrised for all halogens capable of halogen bonding (Cl, Br, and I). The correction is applied on top of the dispersion correction, forming the PM6-D2X method. A comparison with ab initio calculations shows that the method is able to predict the interaction energy of halogen bonds with an error of 10{\%}.},

A hybrid three-layer QM/MM setup (DFT-D/PM6-D3H4X/AMBER in generalized Born solvent) was used here for the first time as an extension of our previous full QM and SQM/MM (SQM means semiempirical QM) approaches. Two approaches to obtain the structures of the CDK2/inhibitor complexes were examined: i) building the modifications from one X-ray structure available coupled with a conformational search and ii) docking the compounds into CDK2. The QM-based scoring entailed a QM/SQM/MM optimization followed by calculations of the binding scores which were subsequently correlated with the experimental binding free energies. The correlation for the building protocol was good (r2 = 0.64, predictive index = 0.81), whereas the docking approach failed. A decomposition of the interaction energies to ligand fragments enabled us to rationalize the differences in the binding affinities. In conclusion, we have developed and refined a QM-based scoring protocol and successfully applied it to reproduce the binding affinities in congeneric series of CDK2 inhibitors and to rationalize their potency. We thus propose that such a tool can be used in computer-aided rational drug design.},

@article{Vorlova:2015,
	abstract = {Overactivation of NMDA receptors has been implicated in various neuropathological conditions, including brain ischaemia, neurodegenerative disorders and epilepsy. Production of d-serine, an NMDA receptor co-agonist, from l-serine is catalyzed in vivo by the pyridoxal-5â²-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme serine racemase. Specific inhibition of this enzyme has been proposed as a promising strategy for treatment of neurological conditions caused by NMDA receptor dysfunction. Here we present the synthesis and activity analysis of a series of malonate-based inhibitors of mouse serine racemase (mSR). The compounds possessed IC50 values ranging from 40 $\pm$11 mM for 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)malonate down to 57 $\pm$1 Î¼M for 2,2-dichloromalonate, the most effective competitive mSR inhibitor known to date. The structure--activity relationship of the whole series in the human orthologue (hSR) was interpreted using Glide docking, WaterMap analysis of hydration and quantum mechanical calculations based on the X-ray structure of the hSR/malonate complex. Docking into the hSR active site with three thermodynamically favourable water molecules was able to discern qualitatively between good and weak inhibitors. Further improvement in ranking was obtained using advanced PM6-D3H4X/COSMO semiempirical quantum mechanics-based scoring which distinguished between the compounds with IC50 better/worse than 2 mM. We have thus not only found a new potent hSR inhibitor but also worked out a computer-assisted protocol to rationalize the binding affinity which will thus aid in search for more effective SR inhibitors. Novel, potent hSR inhibitors may represent interesting research tools as well as drug candidates for treatment of diseases associated with NMDA receptor overactivation.},

The large increase in speed is a result of using a simple series expression for calculated values of properties rather than employing full semiempirical calculations. With this optimization procedure, the rate-determining step for parameterizing elements changes from the mechanics of parameterization to the assembling of experimental reference data.},

The proposed scheme has been implemented, and numerical results for the integrals are reported. A preliminary MNDO parametrization for chlorine indicates that the inclusion ofd orbitals improves the results significantly, compared with the original MNDO and related methods.},

@article{Stewart:2013,
	abstract = {Modern semiempirical methods are of sufficient accuracy when used in the modeling of molecules of the same type as used as reference data in the parameterization. Outside that subset, however, there is an abundance of evidence that these methods are of very limited utility. In an attempt to expand the range of applicability, a new method called PM7 has been developed. PM7 was parameterized using experimental and high-level ab initio reference data, augmented by a new type of reference data intended to better define the structure of parameter space. The resulting method was tested by modeling crystal structures and heats of formation of solids. Two changes were made to the set of approximations: a modification was made to improve the description of noncovalent interactions, and two minor errors in the NDDO formalism were rectified. Average unsigned errors (AUEs) in geometry and ÎHf for PM7 were reduced relative to PM6; for simple gas-phase organic systems, the AUE in bond lengths decreased by about 5 {\%} and the AUE in ÎHf decreased by about 10 {\%}; for organic solids, the AUE in ÎHf dropped by 60 {\%} and the reduction was 33.3 {\%} for geometries. A two-step process (PM7-TS) for calculating the heights of activation barriers has been developed. Using PM7-TS, the AUE in the barrier heights for simple organic reactions was decreased from values of 12.6 kcal/mol-1 in PM6 and 10.8 kcal/mol-1 in PM7 to 3.8 kcal/mol-1. The origins of the errors in NDDO methods have been examined, and were found to be attributable to inadequate and inaccurate reference data. This conclusion provides insight into how these methods can be improved.},
