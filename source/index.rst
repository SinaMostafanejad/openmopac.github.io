MOPAC :cite:p:`Stewart:1990`, the **M**\ olecular **O**\ rbital **PAC**\ kage, is software for performing
quantum chemistry calculations based on semiempirical thermochemistry models (e.g. AM1, PM3, PM6, PM7).
MOPAC has been under active development since 1981, led by James J. P. Stewart.
This website is presently under development.
See http://openmopac.net for the closed-source MOPAC website from which much of the content of this website will be derived.

Ask users to cite MOPAC if they use it to produce results in a scientific publication.
