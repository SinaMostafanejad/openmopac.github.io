=============

| The final one-electron matrix is printed out. This matrix is composed
  of atomic orbitals; the array element between orbitals *φ\ λ*\ and
  *φ\ σ* on different atoms is given by:

   <div align="CENTER">

|\\begin{displaymath}H_{\lambda\sigma} = 0.5 \\times (\beta_\lambda +
\\beta_\sigma) \\times S_{\lambda\sigma}\end{displaymath}|

.. raw:: html

   </div>

| 

The matrix elements between orbitals *φ\ λ*\ and *φ\ σ* on the same atom
are calculated from the electron-nuclear attraction energy, and also
from the *U\ λλ* value if *λ = σ*.

The one-electron matrix is unaffected by (a) the charge and (b) the
electron density. It is only a function of the geometry. Abbreviation:
``1ELEC``.
