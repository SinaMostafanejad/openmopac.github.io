Forces the geometry in the MOPAC input file to be read in :ref:`Gaussian_Zmatrix_format`.
Geometry formatting is usually detected automatically, and this keyword is only necessary if the automatic detection fails.
For example, the automated detection of the Gaussian Z-matrix format fails when multiple MOPAC inputs are concatenated in one input file.
