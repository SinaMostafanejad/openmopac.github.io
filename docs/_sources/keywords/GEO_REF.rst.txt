.. _GEO_REF:

``GEO_REF``
===========

``GEO_REF`` supplies a second geometry to a job.  If more than one line
of keywords is supplied, then this keyword should be on the first line.

There are two ways to specify "*text*" :

(A) Specify the file name and location, e.g.:

| ``GEO_REF="CRAMBIN 1CBN X-ray.mop``"
| ``GEO_REF="CRAMBIN.arc``"
| ``GEO_REF="CRAMBIN.pdb``"
| ``GEO_REF="./CRAMBIN.arc``"
| ``GEO_REF="../CRAMBIN.arc``"
| ``GEO_REF="../../arc files/C``\ RAMBIN.arc"
| ``GEO_REF="sub folder/CRAMBIN.arc``"
| ``GEO_REF=``"./sub folder/CRAMBIN.arc"
| ``GEO_REF="M:\data sets\CRAMBIN 1CBN X-ray.mop``"
| ``GEO_REF="/Users/jstewart/data_sets/CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop``"
| ``GEO_REF="~/data_sets/CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop``"

(B) Use   ``GEO_REF="SELF". ``\ When "SELF" is present, a file that has
the same name as the MOPAC data-set can be used.  By default, this
data-set would be the data-set in the current job.  An alternative would
be to use a data-set in a different folder, for example:

| ``GEO_REF="../Reference geometry/SELF``"
| ``GEO_REF="../../arc files/SELF``"
  ``GEO_REF="C:/PM6 geometries/Self``"

If desired, the suffix can be changed, so if the data-set suffix is
".mop" and the file that is to be used as the ``GEO_REF`` file has the
suffix ".arc", then replace "``SELF``"  with "``SELF.arc``" 

If ``GEO_REF="SELF"`` is used, then the GEO_REF geometry used will be
the one defined in the MOPAC data-set, even if
```RESTART`` <restart.html>`__ is also present.  That is, the GEO_REF
geometry used will be the geometry before any changes caused by
``RESTART`` are applied.  This allows large systems to be restarted
easily.

``GEO_REF``  can be used for `comparing geometries <compare.html>`__,
improving X-ray geometries and also for locating transition states
(using ```LOCATE-TS`` <Locate-TS.html>`__ or
```SADDLE`` <saddle.html>`__). In all cases, the job uses two
geometries, one from the data set or defined using
```GEO_DAT`` <geo_dat.html>`__, and one from a second data set defined
by the keyword ``GEO_REF.`` By default, the ``GEO_REF`` system will be
rotated and translated to minimize the difference between it and the
``GEO_DAT`` geometry.  This operation will not be carried out if keyword
```NOREOR`` <noreor.html>`__ is present.  This allows a strict
comparison of closely-related systems in which some atoms are frozen.

If the file containing the geometry also contains keywords, job name,
etc. these will be ignored.  Only the keywords, job name, etc., in the
MOPAC data set, i.e., the file containing ``GEO_REF=<text>``, will be
used.  Some keywords, such as ```CVB`` <CVB.html>`__, may also require
```GEO-OK`` <geo-ok.html>`__.

Both systems will be converted to simple Cartesian coordinates.  Any
dummy atoms supplied in either the first system or the system defined by
``GEO_REF`` will be ignored, as will any translation vectors. 

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

MOPAC data sets must contain PDB information.  Before any calculation is
started, the two data sets are examined and compared.  For both PDB
files and for MOPAC data sets, the examination consists of checking that
every atom has a unique label. If any of the following strict
requirements is not met, an error message printed and the job will be
stopped:

-  Both species must have the same empirical formula
-  For PDB files and for MOPAC files with PDB information, all atom
   labels must be unique. Atom numbers don't count towards the label.
-  For PDB files and for MOPAC files with PDB information, the same
   labels must be present in both the reference and job data sets. 

It is normal for this test to fail the first time it is run.  Use the
error message to identify the fault, then correct the fault and re-run
the job.  When no errors are reported, the data set labels are
acceptable.

 The following flexibilities are allowed:

-  If the only operation is comparing two geometries, then the species
   can have different empirical formulae. Also, some atoms can have
   different labels, but all such atoms will be excluded from the
   comparison.
-  The order of atoms does not need to be the same.  If the order is
   different, the reference data set will be re-ordered to match the job
   data set.
-  Where there is ambiguity, e.g., Cδ1 and C\ δ2 in Phe and Tyr.
   Ambiguities of this type are automatically resolved by re-labeling
   atoms in the reference data set, unless ```NOSWAP`` <noswap.html>`__
   is present.

From a practical point of view, this flexibility means that the order of
atoms in the two data sets is not important.

The reference data set will then be rotated and translated to give the
best overlap with the job data set.  This new geometry will be printed
as <filename>.new  Total geometric differences between the two
structures will be printed in the output.

Comparing geometries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the keywords ``GEO_REF``, ```0SCF`` <zero_scf.html>`__ and
```HTML`` <html.html>`__ are all present, or if
```COMPARE`` <compare.html>`__ is present, then an HTML web-page will be
written that allows pairs of structures to be compared.

If there are some atoms in one data-set that are not in the other, or
vice versa, then the job will be stopped.  However, if
```GEO-OK`` <geo-ok.html>`__ is present then the job will continue, but
using only the atoms that are common to both data-sets. 

Improving X-ray geometries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The accuracy of native structures, X-ray and NMR, can be increased by
performing a limited geometry optimization, starting with the
conditioned native structure.

The optimized geometry is a hybrid of the PM7 geometry, assuming that
PM7 is used, and the native geometry.  The hybrid heat of formation,
*H*', is given as:

 H' =Δ\ *H\ f\ (*\ PM7) + *c*\ Σ(X:sub:`i` - X\ :sub:`i`\ (0)):sup:`2`

That is, at each geometry, a restraining potential is added to the PM7
heat of formation. The default proportionality constant "*c*" is 3
kcal/mol/Å\ :sup:`2`.  To change the proportionality constant from 3,
put the new value after the reference data set, e.g., if a value of 10
is wanted, use: ``GEO_REF="M:\data_sets\CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop"10`` or
``GEO_REF="CRAMBIN_1CBN_X-ray.mop"10. `` A zero constraint, e.g.,
``GEO_REF="SELF"0`` is allowed if the reference geometry is not to be
used.  This option is useful when the change in geometry is wanted, in
which case ```0SCF`` <zero_scf.html>`__ would likely be used also.

The effect of the restraining potential is to reduce PM7 errors in the
secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.  It has very little
effect on the primary structure, e.g., bond lengths and angles. 

| The effect of the restraining potential can be illustrated using
  Crambin, 1CBN.  In the original structure there was an extra
  C\ :sub:`2`\ O moiety, this was removed.  1CBN has both structural and
  positional disorder; the sequence used was:
| TTCCPSIVARSNFNVCRLPGT\ **P**\ EALCATYTGCIIIPGATCPGDYAN  This sequence
  differs from the later default sequence of
  TTCCPSIVARSNFNVCRLPGT\ **S**\ EALCATYTGCIIIPGATCPGDYAN (difference in
  **bold**)  The formula used was
  C\ :sub:`202`\ H\ :sub:`315`\ N\ :sub:`55`\ O\ :sub:`64`\ S\ :sub:`6`,
  i.e. 642 atoms.  Because the positions of the hydrogen atoms were
  severely incorrect in the X-ray structure, before starting any
  comparison of the effect of ``GEO_REF`` on the geometry, their
  positions were optimized.  During geometry optimization, the COSMO
  solvation model was used because some residues in Crambin were
  reported as being ionized.\ |image0|

|image1|\ The difference in heat of formation of Crambin, after
preconditioning (that is, after the positions of the hydrogen atoms were
optimized), and after complete geometry optimization, is ~250 kcal
mol\ :sup:`-1`. The RMS change in geometry is about 1.0 Ångstroms.  If
the geometry is optimized using ``GEO_REF`` and a constant, *c*, of 1.0,
then the heat of formation drops by ~150 kcal mol\ :sup:`-1`, and the
RMS geometry change is ~0.25 Ångstroms.  In other words, by allowing the
X-ray geometry to change by 0.25 Ångstroms, over half of the strain
energy in the X-ray structure is removed.  Put yet another way, the
resulting geometry is more than twice as accurate, in terms of
chemistry, than the X-ray structure.  `All Crambin structures used
here <Crambin_Aq_geo_ref.zip>`__.

Locating transition states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``GEO_REF`` can also be used for moving a reactant or product geometry
in the direction of the transition state.  Consider two data sets,
reactant.mop and product.mop in folder M:\, in which the heat of
formation of the optimized product geometry is lower than that of the
optimized reactant geometry.  The product geometry geometry can be moved
in the direction of the transition state by using keyword
``GEO_REF="M:\reactant.mop"``  The .arc file can then be edited to give
a new data set, product_on_slope.mop.  The reactant geometry can then be
moved in the direction of this new geometry by using keyword
``GEO_REF="M:\product_on_slope.mop"``  Again, edit the .arc file to give
reactant_on_slope.mop.  Why was the product moved first?  Because by
moving it towards the reactant geometry, its heat of formation would
rise in proportion to the distance to the reactant geometry. When the
reactant geometry is moved towards the product geometry on the slope,
the distance from the starting reactant geometry to the product geometry
on the slope is less, so the rise in energy would be less.

If keyword TS is present in a GEO_REF calculation, the optimization is
not run.  Instead, the two geometries are averaged, and the result
written to a new file <file>.new.

For the current exercise, a good approximation to the transition state
can then be generated from the data set reactant_on_slope.mop by using
keywords TS and ``GEO_REF="M:\product_on_slope.mop"``

Error: "Fault detected in atom labels in a GEO_REF run"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the only faults detected are those that involve hydrogen atoms, then
add keyword ```GEO-OK`` <geo-ok.html>`__, and do not have
```NOSWAP`` <noswap.html>`__, and re-run. The hydrogen atoms will be put
in their correct place automatically. Alternatively, edit either the
data-set or the ``GEO_REF`` file to remove the fault.
