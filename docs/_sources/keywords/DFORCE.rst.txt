``DFORCE``
==========

Print some of the working in the FORCE calculation.

Caution: By default, the geometry is rotated so that the principal
moments of inertia are oriented along the Cartesian axes, *x*, *y*, and
*z*. This can cause problems in using the printed Hessian matrix. If
this is not wanted, add keyword ```NOREOR`` <noreor.html>`__.
