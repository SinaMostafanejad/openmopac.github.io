PM7-TS
======

Use the PM7-TS semiempirical model :cite:p:`Stewart:2013` instead of the default model, PM7.
It is a reparameterization of the PM7 model intended for more accurate calculations of transition states and barrier heights.
See the :ref:`model_overview` for a comparison of the various models available in MOPAC.

.. note:
  PM7-TS is not intended for use with geometry relaxation.
  It is intended for use with transition state geometries that have already been optimized using PM7.
