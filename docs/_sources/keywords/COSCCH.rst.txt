.. _COSCCH:

``COSCCH``
==========

In a COSMO calculation, where the `COSWRT <coswrt.html>`__ is used,
COSCCH allows for bond dipole and bond quadrupole corrections before the
final COSMO calculation.  Quadrupoles require a charge dq on the bond
between atoms i1, and i2. The syntax is dq: i1 i2 dq.

The list of dq correction charges is followed by a list of correction
charges on all atoms.
