.. _PECI:

``PECI``
========

In a C.I., the microstates used are: (a) the ground state; (b) all
one-electron excitations; and (c) all closed shell (paired) two-electron
excitations. ``PECI`` = Paired Electron Configuration Interaction.
Because of the definition of ``PECI``, only Singlet and Triplet states
can be generated.
