.. _MECI:

MECI
====

Prints the details of a Multi-Electron Configuration Interaction calculation :cite:p:`Armstrong:1972`.
To print MECI state vectors, the :ref:`LARGE` keyword should also be specified.

.. note::
  This keyword does not initiate an MECI calculation itself.
  It only works in conjunction with other keywords such as :ref:`C.I.` and :ref:`OPEN` that initiate MECI calculations.
