.. _MECI:

``MECI``
========

If ``MECI`` is specified, then details of the `Multi Electron
Configuration
Interaction <theory.html#Multi-Electron%20Configuration%20Interaction>`__
calculation [`39 <references.html#meci>`__] are printed at the end of
the calculation. The state vectors can be printed by specifying ``MECI``
and ``LARGE``. The MECI calculation is either invoked automatically, or
explicitly invoked by the use of keywords such as  ``C.I.=n`` and
``OPEN(n,n).``
