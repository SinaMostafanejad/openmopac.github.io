.. _STEP1:

``STEP1``
=========

In a grid calculation the step size in degrees or Ã…ngstroms for the
first of the two parameters is given by *n*.\ *nnn*. By default, an 11
by 11 grid is generated. See ``POINT1`` and ``POINT2`` on how to adjust
this number. The first point calculated is the supplied geometry, and is
in the upper left hand corner. See also ``STEP2=n.nnn``.
