.. _SNAP:

``SNAP``
========

Many symmetry-defined angles, such as the tetrahedral angle
109.471221...are difficult to type. If ``SNAP`` is used, then any angle
near to a symmetry-defined angle will be adjusted to that angle. Thus
109.471 would become arcos(-1/3) accurate to 15 or 16 figures. The
tolerance of SNAP is quite strict, so 109.47 would NOT be recognized.
