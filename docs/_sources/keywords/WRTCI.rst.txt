.. _WRTCI:

``WRTCI``
=========

Available for ```INDO`` <indo.html>`__-based CI calculations only. Print
up to the *n* lowest energy excited states in the output file. The
default value is 500. In general, this should be no more than 1/4-1/3 of
```MAXCI`` <maxci.html>`__. If ``WRTCI`` is larger than this, some of
the CI states that are printed may have energies that are affected
noticeably by the choice of ``MAXCI``.
