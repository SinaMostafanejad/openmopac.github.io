==========

When irreducible representations are being assigned to eigenvectors
(M.O.s, state functions, and normal modes), print the characters of the
eigenvectors for the symmetry operations of the point group, and print
the number of irreducible representations of each class.Â  Useful in
diagnostics and in teaching.
