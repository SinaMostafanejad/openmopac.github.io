.. _TRANS:

``TRANS=n``
===========

The facility exists to allow the ``THERMO`` calculation to handle
systems with internal rotations. ``TRANS=n`` will remove the *n* lowest
vibrations. Note that ``TRANS=1`` is equivalent to ``TRANS`` on its own.
For xylene, for example, ``TRANS=2`` would be suitable.
