.. _QMMM:

 

``QMMM`` (Alt.: ``MOL_QMMM``)
=============================

``QMMM`` incorporates environmental effects in terms of the QM/MM
approach.  This keyword, its description, and implementation into MOPAC
was based on materials developed and provided by Prof Arieh Warshel and
Dr Nikolay Plotnikov, University of Southern California. 

This option is intended for use with other software, and requires a
knowledge of how to construct a mol.in file.  Users should become
familiar with MM software before attempting to use ``QMMM``.

To use ``QMMM``, a file called mol.in must be present in the folder that
contains the data set.  The format of of mol.in is described below.

Introduction
============

A hybrid quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics approach QM/MM\ :sup:`1`
has become a powerful modeling technique\ :sup:`2-4`. This method allows
one to capture the electrostatic effects of surrounding “solvent” in
complex polar and microscopically inhomogeneous environment (e.g. water,
protein, zeolites, etc.) on “solute” (e.g. reactants, enzyme active
center, chromophore, etc.) “Solute” is treated at the QM level of
theory, while “solvent” is described with a MM model. The QM/MM approach
is particularly effective when less expensive implicit solvation models
are inapplicable\ :sup:`5`.

In the QM/MM approach, it is crucial to describe coupling between the QM
and the MM regions, in particular polarization of solute by polar
environment. Not doing so will for example lead to having NaCl
dissociating to Na and Cl instead of Na\ :sup:`+` Cl\ :sup:`-` in
water\ :sup:`6`.

In the case of semi-empirical Hamiltonians it is quite simple to
incorporate the effect of solvent into semi-empirical QM/MM Hamiltonian
by adding the interaction energy of an electron with the electrostatic
potential created by solvent (MM atoms) to the one-electron diagonal
elements of Hamiltonian\ :sup:`1,7,8`:

here *h\ νν* is the gas phase one-electron Hamiltonian elements with the
ν-\ *th* orbital centered on atom *i* and *q\ j* being the charge of the
MM atom *j* where  *j* goes over all MM atoms.

This simple modification is implemented\ :sup:`5` in MOPAC.The required
electrostatic potentials on QM atoms from all MM atoms are calculated
with the MOLARIS-XG simulation package, which also calculates the
corresponding QM/MM electrostatic energy derivatives using the charges
provided by MOPAC. This allows to perform almost any QM/MM calculation
(e.g. activation free energy barrier, average dipole moments, absorption
and emission spectra). Furthermore, this functionality allows for a
general interface between MOPAC and any MM program (e.g.
`GROMACS <http://www.gromacs.org/>`__)

Format of MOL.IN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that MM program must provide an additional input file mol.in in the
following format:

<empty line>

n1 n2

0 0 0 0 φ(\ *1*)

…

0 0 0 0 φ(\ *n*)

where n1 is the number of atoms, n1 is the number of linked atoms, *n*
is number of QM atoms (including link atoms), and

*φ(i)*\  units are kcal/(mol∙\ e) where e is the elementary charge. If
the atomic distance, r\ ij, is given in Ångstroms, and q\ j is expressed
in fraction of the elementary charge (e.g. -1 for an electron) then
φ(i)\  is given by:

| 
| This file should be in the directory where MOPAC is being executed.

The output created by MOPAC includes the effect of environment on
energy, heat of formation, charge distribution, dipole moments. Energy
derivatives include only QM intra-molecular contributions. However, the
QM charge distribution can be used to calculate electrostatic QM/MM
contribution to force according to the MM force-field formalism.

Example
=======

The file mol.in provides the various φ(i).  These are given in lines 3
on, in column 5, as shown in the following example. The first line is is
skipped, the second line of mol.in should have two integer numbers that
add to the total the total number of atoms.  If you are building this
file using an editor, a useful default is to set the first number equal
to the total number of atoms and to make the second number zero. 
Typically, this file would be created by the MM program, in which case
do not edit the file.

Use of MOPAC standard output AUX file
=====================================

Advanced users interested in implementing the QM/MM interface with
MM-packages should use the MOPAC2016 keyword\ ``AUX``  to create an
auxiliary file which contains all the data necessary for propagating MD
trajectories and for MC sampling. To use this function in a MOPAC job,
simply include keyword ``AUX``.  An example of a typical keyword line
would be:

PM6 1SCF CHARGE=-1 GRAD AUX QMMM

(the keywords ```1SCF`` <one_scf.html>`__ and
```GRAD`` <gradients.html>`__ are both necessary; ``1SCF`` because the
gradients of the supplied geometry are needed, and ``GRAD`` because, by
default, gradients are not calculated when ``1SCF`` is used.)

In the <file>.aux file the corresponding entries for energies, heat of
formation, atomic charges and gradients can be found under Final SCF
results, e.g.:

Applications, computational cost and accuracy
=============================================

The QM/MM approach nowadays is an extremely popular
approach\ :sup:`2-4`. Due to its low computational cost semi-empirical
QM/MM methods are widely used in molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo and
minimization approaches with variety of different program-specific
implementations\ :sup:`9,10`. Modeling with the explicit solvent is the
most accurate and physically meaningful way to describe environmental
effects, but it comes at a higher computational cost. For example, the
activation free energy barrier calculated\ :sup:`5` for a S\ :sub:`N`\ 2
reaction between methyl chloride and chloride in water is predicted by
the COSMO model to be ~18 kcal/mol, while the PM3/MM estimate, at 27-29
kcal/mol (for ESP charges and Mulliken charges models , respectively) is
in perfect agreement with the experimental estimate of 26.6). Another
application is the calculation of vertical excitation energies in polar
environment, e.g. in fluorescent proteins and photoactive dyes, where
atomistic polarizable solvent models are critical for a reliable
prediction of the solvatochromic shift\ :sup:`11`. Another area where
QM/MM with explicit solvation is advantageous (and essential ) is the
evaluation  of the  binding free energy in enzymatic binding
pockets\ :sup:`12`

While the treatment of the entire system quantum mechanically is still
very computationally expensive, the QM/MM approach allows one to explore
a numerous problems in biochemistry with a reasonable computational
cost. The accuracy of the semi-empirical QM/MM description can be
further improved by perturbatively moving to a higher level of theory
using the Paradynamics approach\ :sup:`5`.

 

Additional technical details
============================

In the described QM/MM implementation, the heat of formation and
energies reported by MOPAC contain all electrostatic QM/MM coupling
terms, including interaction between QM and MM nuclei.

The derivatives, which are read from MOPAC, contain only QM
contributions, and the QM/MM electrostatic term is evaluated by the MM
program, using the derived charge distribution for QM atoms from MOPAC.

The charge model for QM from MOPAC can be Mulliken or ESP, Mulliken
charges are obtained  faster but ESP  charges are  more physical.
